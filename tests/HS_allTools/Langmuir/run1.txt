The dependent variable, y, decreases as the independent variable, x1, decreases. \n\nA suitable equation could be a power or exponential function or a combination of both. \n\nGiven that we are dealing with physical quantities, it's reasonable to first try out a power law function of the form y = c0*x1^c1 where c0 and c1 are constants. \n\nFor the second expression, we could try an exponential function of the form y = c0*exp(-c1*x1) since the y values decrease as x1 decreases. It's also common in physics for exponential decay processes to be described by such equations.\n\nLastly, we could also try a function of the form y = c0*sqrt(x1) + c1 since the relationship between y and x1 could be inversely proportional to the square root of x1.",

The lowest complexity is 5 with a quite good loss (1.79), and the lowest loss is 0.30 with a complexity of 6.

We already have a power law in the list but I can suggest a slightly different form which might give similar results but with a lower complexity. Instead of 'c[0]*x1**c[1]', we can try 'x1**c[0]'.\n\n2) Another possible approach would be to use logarithmic and exponential functions. The provided equations already include some of these, but we can try to combine them in a different way.
