  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the constraints on the equation form, we want to create diverse expressions which are not SR-similar to the existing ones. We also want to keep the complexity low and create meaningful expressions in the context of the physical process we are trying to model.\n\n1. Looking at the data, it seems that the loading (y) decreases as the pressure (x1) increases. This could be modelled by a simple linear equation with a negative gradient. However, a linear model is already included in the Pareto front so we need to think of something different. One option could be to introduce a logarithmic term, which would capture the rate of decrease slowing down as pressure increases. This would lead to a model of the form y = c0 - c1*log(x1). This model has a complexity of 6, same as one of the existing models but it is not SR-similar to any of them.\n\n2. Another option could be to introduce a square root term. This would also capture the idea of the rate of decrease slowing down as pressure increases. A possible model could be y = c0 - sqrt(c1*x1). This model has a complexity of 5 which is lower than all the existing models in the Pareto front.\n\n3. Finally, we could introduce a cubic term. This would capture any potential non-linearities in the relationship between loading and pressure. A possible model could be y = c0 - c1*x1^3. This model has a complexity of 7, which is lower than one of the existing models in the Pareto front but higher than the other two.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided Pareto front, I notice some patterns in the equations. The top performing equations involve operations of division, subtraction, and the use of exponential and logarithmic functions.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the dataset, we can see that the dependent variable decreases as the independent variable decreases. This suggests that the two variables are inversely related. However, the decrease is not linear, indicating that some transformation of the independent variable may be required.\n\nThe analysis of the accuracy and complexity Pareto front shows a diverse set of equations with varying complexity and mean squared error (mse). The simplest equation 'c[0]/x1' has the highest mse, suggesting that a simple inverse relationship is not sufficient to model the data accurately.\n\nThe equation with the lowest mse 'c[0]-c[1]*log(x1)' suggests a logarithmic relationship between the variables, which is common in adsorption studies. However, this equation has a relatively high complexity.\n\nOther equations suggest the use of exponential 'c[0]*exp(-c[1]*x1)' and square root transformations 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)'. \n\nKeeping these observations in mind, we can propose new equations that have a balance of complexity and accuracy.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the dataset, it appears that the dependent variable (y) is decreasing, while the independent variable (x1) is increasing. This suggests an inverse or logarithmic relationship between the two variables. \n\nCurrently, the best performing expressions are those that incorporate exponential, square root, and logarithmic functions. This suggests that the underlying relationship might involve these mathematical operations.\n\nConsidering the constraints on complexity and similarity, the following three expressions can be suggested:\n\n1. c0 / (x1 ** c1): This expression captures the inverse relationship between x1 and y. The introduction of the constant c1 allows for non-integer powers, potentially providing a better fit to the data.\n\n2. c0 * log(x1 ** c1): This expression is a modification of the already successful 'c[0]-c[1]*log(x1)' formula. Introducing the constant c1 as the power of x1 in the logarithm might provide a better fit to the data.\n\n3. c0 * (x1 ** -0.5): This expression uses the square root function indirectly by raising x1 to the power of -0.5.
