This suggests there's an inverse relationship between the two variables. \n\nLet's try with the simplest inverse relationship: y = c0 / x1. \n\nHowever, because of the nature of the problem (nitrogen adsorbing onto mica), it seems that an exponential decay might be a better fit. This can be represented as y = c0 * exp(-c1 * x1).\n\nFinally, because the decrease is not linear, a logarithmic relationship might be a good fit too: y = c0 - c1 * log(x1).",

  "LLM Thoughts": "The given dataset could be modelled using basic operators and functions. We are given the equations that have already been suggested and we need to provide diverse equations. The existing equations are 'c[0]/x1', 'c[0]*exp(-c[1]*x1)', and 'c[0]-c[1]*log(x1)'. The dependent variable 'y' is inversely related to the independent variable 'x1', as y decreases when x1 increases. This relationship is captured in the first equation 'c[0]/x1'. The second equation 'c[0]*exp(-c[1]*x1)' models an exponential decay which is also seen in the data. The third equation 'c[0]-c[1]*log(x1)' models a logarithmic decay, again seen in the data. \n\nWe want to suggest new equations that are not SR-similar to the existing equations. 'SR-similar' means that the equations could be transformed into each other by fitting constants. So, we need to suggest equations that have a different form.\n\nWe could use combinations of the allowed operators and functions to create the new equations. For example, we could use the square function in the equation as 'c[0]/(x1^2)'. We could also use the cube function as 'c[0]/(x1^3)'. The sqrt function could be used as 'c[0]/sqrt(x1)'. All these equations model the inverse relationship between y and x1 and add a level of non-linearity to the relationship.",
