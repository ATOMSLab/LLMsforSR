  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the data, it seems that y increases with x1 in a nonlinear, almost logarithmic way. This suggests that a logarithmic term might be involved in the equation. However, the increase is not strictly logarithmic, as it appears to slow down after a certain point. This suggests that the equation might also involve a term that decreases with x1, possibly a reciprocal or a term with a negative exponent. It could also involve a term that increases with x1, but at a slower rate than the logarithmic term, such as a square root. Additionally, it could involve a constant term to account for the initial y value when x1 is near zero.\n\nPossible expressions:\n1. c0*log(x1) + c1\n2. c0*log(x1) + c1/x1\n3. c0*log(x1) + c1*sqrt(x1)",
