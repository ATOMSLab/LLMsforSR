In this dataset, we have the independent variable x1 which represents the proper distance to a galaxy 
  and the dependent variable y which is the speed of separation. This is closely related to Hubble's Law in physical cosmology, which states 
  that the speed of a galaxy (y) is approximately proportional to its distance (x1). The simplest form of this relationship is y = c0 * x1, 
  where c0 is the Hubble constant. 

However, due to the restrictions and the complexity of physical cosmology, we should consider non-linear 
  relationships as well. Possible transformations include:

1. Polynomial relationships, such as y = c0 * x1^2 or y = c0 * x1^3, as they can 
  capture more complex dynamics.
2. Logarithmic or exponential relationships, which might describe certain cosmological phenomena where the 
  speed increases rapidly or levels off.
3. Square root transformations, which are sometimes used in scaling relations in physics.
  

Given the allowed operators and transformations, I will consider a mix of these potential forms to find three expressions.
  

Possible expressions:
1. Linear: y = c0 * x1
2. Quadratic: y = c0 * x1^2
3. Exponential: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)

Let's propose t...

1. 
  The dataset is related to physical cosmology, which often involves relationships similar to Hubble's Law. 
  One common expression could be a linear relationship, suggesting that speed is proportional to distance. 
  This could be represented as y = c0 * x1.

2. Another possibility is to consider non-linear relationships. 
  In cosmology, sometimes quadratic or cubic terms are used to account for more complex relationships. 
  An expression like y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 could be plausible.

3. Considering higher powers or transformations, 
  cubic relationships or logarithmic transformations might also depict the potential physics involved. An expression such as y = c0 * x1^3 or y = c0 * log(x1) could be evaluated to see if they fit the pattern of the dataset.

4. We should also consider expressions that involve the square root function, as sometimes the relationship between variables can be described using root functions. An expression like y = c0 * sqrt(x1) could be another candidate.

Overall, the goal is to find expressions that capture the linear and potential non-linear relati...

1. The problem involves finding expressions for the speed of separation of a galaxy given its proper 
  distance. In cosmology, the relationship between distance and speed is often linear due to the Hubble's law, but we can explore non-linear 
  relationships as well.
  
2. We have to come up with expressions using the allowed operators and not fit constants directly, 
  but use placeholders like c0, c1, etc.

3. An initial simple expression could be a linear one: y = c0 * x1. 
  This is similar to Hubble's law (v = H0 * d), which is linear.

4. Considering non-linear possibilities:
   
  - A quadratic relationship: y = c0 * x1^2. This could represent scenarios where acceleration is involved.
   
  - Using a logarithmic relationship: y = c0 * log(x1). This could model a slower rate of speed increase with distance.
  
   - An exponential relationship: y = exp(c0 * x1). This could depict rapid acceleration at larger distances.

5. 
   Other combinations could involve square roots or cubes, but they have to be plausible in the physical cosmology context....

      ...Scratch Pad:
1. The dataset involves the speed of separation of galaxies (y) and their proper distance (x1), 
  which suggests a potential relationship similar to Hubble's Law. According to Hubble's Law, the velocity (y) is proportional to the distance (x1), 
  which can be expressed as y = c0 * x1.
   
2. Given the restrictions, we can explore polynomial and transcendental forms. 
  We consider the following transformations of x1:
   - Powers: x1^2, x1^3
   - Roots: sqrt(x1)
   - Logarithmic: log(x1)
   
  - Exponential: exp(x1)

3. Possible expressions:
   - Linear expression: y = c0 * x1 (Hubble's Law analogy)
   
  - Quadratic or cubic expressions could capture any nonlinearities: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 or y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^3
   
  - Logarithmic or square root transformations may capture diminishing returns or growth: y = c0 * log(x1) or y = c0 * sqrt(x1)
   
  - Exponential might capture rapid growth: y = c0 * exp(x1)

4. Prioritize simplicity but consider forms that could capture potential 
  underlying physical laws or behaviors in cosmic expansion.

Potential expressions:
- Linear: c0 * x1
- Polynomial: c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2

  - Exponentia...

      ...Scratch Pad:

1. The context of the dataset is related to the speed of galaxy separation, which often ties 
  into Hubble's Law. This suggests a linear relationship between the distance and speed, so I should consider a linear 
  expression involving x1.

2. Since the data might have non-linear characteristics, I should consider non-linear transformations. Possible transformations include quadratic and cubic terms, as well as logarithmic and exponential functions.

3. Given the operators allowed, I can explore:
   - Linear relation: y = c0 * x1
   - Quadratic relation: y = c0 * x1^2
   - Exponential relation: y = exp(c0 * x1)
   - Logarithmic relation: y = log(c0 * x1)

4. I should also consider combinations of transformations and operations to capture more complex patterns.

5. I must make the expressions concise while capturing the potential nature of the cosmological data....
