Equation 5 has the lowest complexity but a higher mse. Equation 8 provides a good balance between complexity and mse.\n\nTo suggest new equations, we aim to minimize mse while keeping the complexity low. We'll avoid using expressions that are SR-similar to the ones listed. \n\nConsidering the restrictions and the context (cosmology, speed of separation, proper distance), we will explore combinations of log, exp, and polynomials. We will focus on expressions incorporating both simplicity and diverse mathematical operations to potentially capture different aspects of the dataset.\n\n1. Let's try a simple polynomial with square: c0*x1**2 - this would be a simple polynomial approach.\n2. We can try an expression using a mix of logarithm and linear terms: c0*log(x1) + c1*x1 - combining logarithmic and linear terms might capture different scaling behaviors.\n3. Finally, an expression using exponential and inverse terms: c0*exp(-x1) + c1/x1 - this could model rapid decay and an inverse relation.",
