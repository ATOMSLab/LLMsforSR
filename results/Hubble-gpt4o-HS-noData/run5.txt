  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nFrom the provided expressions, we need to identify patterns and suggest diverse expressions with low complexity and reduced mean squared error (mse). The dataset is related to physical cosmology, with 'x1' representing the proper distance to a galaxy and 'y' representing its speed of separation.\n\n1. Observations from the existing expressions:\n   - Simplicity often involves linear, logarithmic, or exponential terms.\n   - More complex expressions utilize combinations of sqrt and exp functions.\n   - Complexity ranges from 3 to 13, while mse ranges from 26982 to 41915.\n\n2. Analyzing the provided equations:\n   - The simplest equation is 'c[0]*x1' with complexity 3 and mse 31135.\n   - The most complex equation is 'c[0]*exp(-c[1]*x1**2)+c[2]' with complexity 12 and mse 26982.\n   - The best mse is achieved by 'c[0]*exp(-c[1]*x1**2)+c[2]', which uses an exponential decay dependent on x1 squared.\n\n3. Suggesting new expressions:\n   - Consider variations and combinations of existing patterns that are not SR-similar.\n   - Leverage the use of sqrt, log, and exp to explore different dynamics with x1.\n\nNew equations:\n1. Explore a combination of exponential and logarithmic terms since they are prevalent in physical models due to their nature of growth and decay.\n   - Try something like 'c[0]*exp(-x1) + c[1]*log(x1)', which might capture both exponential decay and logarithmic growth or decay.\n\n2. Utilize the sqrt function with another simple term that hasn't been used much.\n   - Use a form like 'c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*x1**2', combining polynomial growth with root-based scaling.\n\n3. Combinations of linear and logarithmic terms can provide a good balance of simplicity and fitting ability.\n   - Consider 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*log(x1)', allowing both linear growth and slowing effects of log.",
