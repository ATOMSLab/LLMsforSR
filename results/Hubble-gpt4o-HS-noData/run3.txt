  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The problem involves finding expressions for the speed of separation of a galaxy given its proper 
  distance. In cosmology, the relationship between distance and speed is often linear due to the Hubble's law, but we can explore non-linear 
  relationships as well.\n  \n2. We have to come up with expressions using the allowed operators and not fit constants directly, 
  but use placeholders like c0, c1, etc.\n\n3. An initial simple expression could be a linear one: y = c0 * x1. 
  This is similar to Hubble's law (v = H0 * d), which is linear.\n\n4. Considering non-linear possibilities:\n   
  - A quadratic relationship: y = c0 * x1^2. This could represent scenarios where acceleration is involved.\n   
  - Using a logarithmic relationship: y = c0 * log(x1). This could model a slower rate of speed increase with distance.\n  
   - An exponential relationship: y = exp(c0 * x1). This could depict rapid acceleration at larger distances.\n\n5. 
   Other combinations could involve square roots or cubes, but they have to be plausible in the physical cosmology context.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The dataset is related to physical cosmology, focusing on the relationship between distance and velocity. The existing solutions have provided three expressions with different complexities and mean squared errors (MSEs).\n\n2. The simplest provided expression is `c[0]*x1` with a complexity of 3 and MSE of 31135.22. This linear relationship is straightforward but can be improved upon with non-linear expressions given the context of physical cosmology, where non-linear relationships are common due to factors like gravitational effects.\n\n3. The expression `c[0]*x1**2` offers a quadratic relationship with higher complexity (5) and a larger MSE (67241.67) than the linear expression. It suggests a non-linear trend, but the MSE indicates it may not capture the underlying pattern effectively.\n\n4. The expression `c[0]*log(x1)` has the highest complexity (4) but also the highest MSE (290254.05), indicating a poor fit for the given data. Logarithmic transformations often help linearize exponential growth or decay, but may not suit the dataset perfectly.\n\n5. To improve on these, we should explore combinations that balance complexity and accuracy, avoid SR-similar expressions, and consider physical principles.\n\n6. Potential new equations could involve common cosmological transformations like inverse relationships or square roots, given the dataset's nature.\n\n7. Possible suggestions:\n   - A combination of inverse and linear terms to capture decelerating separations.\n   - An exponential term to account for possible rapid changes in velocity.\n   - A square root term to model diminishing returns on velocity with increasing distance.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the complexity and MSE values of the previous equations, I need to suggest new equations that are both diverse and potentially lower in complexity and/or MSE. \n\n1. From the list, the simplest equation is 'c[0]*x1', which has a complexity of 3 and MSE of 31135.22243454. This is a linear relationship, the simplest form of expression, and acts as a baseline. Any new suggestion should ideally have a complexity greater than 3 if it aims to improve accuracy.\n\n2. The complexity of 4 (logarithmic) shows a high MSE value, indicating that logarithmic transformations might not be ideal for this dataset.\n\n3. 'c[0]*x1**2' with a complexity of 5 has a significant reduction in MSE to 67241.66755131, indicating that quadratic terms provide a better fit than logarithmic ones.\n\n4. The equation 'c[0]*exp(x1)-c[1]' with complexity 6 gives a better MSE of 46512.3249484 compared to the quadratic term, suggesting that the exponential form might capture some non-linear aspects of the data well.\n\n5. The complexity of 7 and 8 equations involve combinations of linear and non-linear terms, which reduce the MSE further to around 30900-31126. These are combinations of linear, inverse, and square root terms, indicating that a combination of these could be beneficial.\n\nTo improve further, I need to diversify and combine some of these transformations while keeping complexity moderate.\n\nNew Suggestions:\n- Try combining linear and inverse terms with x1, potentially using a cube for added non-linearity.\n- Explore the use of squares and square roots in combination with linear terms to capture different non-linear behaviors.\n- Consider a division or subtraction of square or cube terms that might capture more complex interactions.\n\nPotential Equations:\n1. c[0]*x1**3 + c[1]/x1\n2. c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1**2 - c[2]*sqrt(x1)\n3. c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*x1 - c[2]/x1\n\nThese equations aim to capture a range of potential relationships from linear to cubic with combinations of inverses and square roots, providing diverse options for fitting the data.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nFrom the given Pareto front data, we have equations of varying complexity and mean squared error (mse). Our task is to suggest new equations that can potentially minimize both complexity and mse while maintaining diversity among the equations.\n\nThe current equations range from simple polynomial forms to those involving exponential and square root functions. Observing the mse values, the equation with the lowest mse from the list is 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2-c[2]*sqrt(x1)' with a complexity of 14. To suggest new equations, it's beneficial to consider combinations or variations of the existing structures while introducing new operators or forms that have not been heavily represented.\n\n1. We notice that the equation 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2-c[2]*sqrt(x1)' incorporates polynomial and square root terms, which have yielded a low mse. A potential new structure could involve the logarithmic function, which hasn't been explored in the provided equations.\n\n2. Another approach is to consider more complex interactions between the exponential and polynomial terms. For example, while 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*exp(x1)' shows a promising mse, we can explore an equation that combines these terms differently, perhaps through division or another operation.\n\n3. Lastly, exploring higher-order polynomials or combinations of different unary operations could provide new insights.\n\nConsidering the above reasoning and restrictions, the following new equations are suggested:\n\n1. An equation involving logarithm: Logarithm hasn't been used and can be a powerful transformation, especially for multiplicative processes in cosmology.\n\n2. A combination of exponential and polynomial terms with division: This could capture nonlinear growth patterns and potentially reduce mse.\n\n3.
