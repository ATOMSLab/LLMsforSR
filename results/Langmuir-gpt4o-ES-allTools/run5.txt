A simple linear model might be a good starting point. However, the decrease in y is not uniform, suggesting a potential non-linear relationship.\n\n3. Considering a possible inverse relationship, an expression of the form y = c0 - c1*x1 might capture the overall trend.\n\n4. Since the decrease in y becomes less steep as x1 increases, a term like c2/x1 could be appropriate to model this deceleration.\n\n5. A combination of linear and inverse terms, such as y = c0 - c1*x1 + c2/x1, could potentially fit the data better.\n\n6. Since there is only one independent variable, try to explore combinations using only x1. Avoiding complex forms, focus on linear, inverse, and simple multiplicative relationships.\n\n7.
