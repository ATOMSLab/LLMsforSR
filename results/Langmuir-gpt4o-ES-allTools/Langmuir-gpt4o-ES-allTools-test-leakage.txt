- The current Pareto front contains four equations with varying complexity and mean squared error (mse).
- The simplest equation is a linear function with complexity 5 and mse 6.88412121, while more complex equations with lower mse revolve around rational forms.
- The second equation with complexity 7, mse 0.12263081, is already relatively simple, suggesting rational forms are effective for this dataset.
- The third and fourth equations both have mse 0.12213021 and slightly higher complexity, suggesting diminishing returns on additional complexity.
- We need to propose three new equations that are simple yet effective, ideally with complexity â‰¤ 9 and mse comparable to the best existing equations.
- Considering the dataset's nature (adsorption isotherms), rational functions and forms with saturation effects (e.g., Langmuir-like) are promising.
- We should avoid SR-similar expressions, ensuring diversity in proposed equations.

Potential new expressions:
1. Rational function with three parameters to capture saturation effects, ensuring distinct parameterization from existing expressions.
2. Linear plus rational term, offering a hybrid approach potentially capturing additional nuances.
3. Rational function with a form slightly different from existing ones, perhaps incorporating a shift or offset....

      ...Scratch Pad:


  1. Analyze the previous equations and their MSE:
   
  - 'c[0]/x1': This is a simple inverse relationship with a high MSE.
   
  - 'c[0]/x1+c[1]/(x1+c[2])': More complex, combining two inverses, with a significantly lower MSE.
   
  - 'c[0]-c[1]/x1': A linear term with an inverse, lower MSE.
  
   - 'c[0]/(x1-c[1])+c[2]': An inverse with a shift, has the lowest MSE.


   2. Consider the nature of the data:
   
   - The dataset suggests a potentially hyperbolic or inverse relationship given the nature of adsorption 
   (often characterized by Langmuir or Freundlich type isotherms).
   
   - The previous expressions are effective with inverse relationships and constant shifts.


   3. Generate new potential expressions:
   
   - Avoid SR-similar expressions:
     
   - "c0/(x1+c1)" and "c0/(x1-c1)" are SR-similar.
     
   - "c0-x1*c1" and "c0+x1*c1" are SR-similar when only a linear factor is added.
   
   - Focus on diversity and simplicity:
     
   - Add combinations of linear and inverse relationships.
    
    - Consider expressions that might capture asymptotic behavior.


    4. Suggested expressions:
   
    - Try combining inverse elements with linear terms or different combinations of shifts.
   
    - Ensure expressions are not variations of already existing SR-similar forms....

  - 'c[0]+c[1]*(x1)/(c[2]+x1+x1*x1)': Slightly more complex, using a rational function with a quadratic denominator, 
  complexity 13, mse 0.25395246.

  2. Observations:
   - Many of the existing equations utilize rational functions, which seem to be effective.
   
  - The lowest complexity equation has a high mse, while the most complex ones have lower mse.
   
  - We need to avoid expressions that are SR-similar to the above, focusing on different structures.


  3. New Equation Suggestions:
   - Consider using a form that combines multiplication and division differently.
   
  - Explore combinations of terms that might mimic adsorption processes, such as Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms without making 
  them SR-similar.


  4. Potential New Structures:
   
  - Try structures that involve combinations of terms like c0*x1 - c1/(c2 + x1), which is different from existing ones.
   
  - Consider a form like c0 - c1*x1/(c2 + x1) where subtraction is used to introduce diversity.
   
  - Use structures that have alternating signs or different arrangements, such as (c0 + c1 * x1) / (c2 - x1)....

The given dataset shows nitrogen loading as a function of pressure on mica. Let's analyze this:

1. **Linear Model:** The simplest model is a linear one, like `c[0]*x1 + c[1]`. However, this model has a high MSE, suggesting a non-linear relationship.

2. **Rational Functions:** The suggested models indicate that rational functions of the form `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)` perform well in terms of MSE, suggesting a saturation behavior as pressure increases.

3. **Evaluating Existing Models:**
   - Model 1: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]` has high MSE, indicating a poor fit.
   - Model 2: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1/(1 + x1)` shows improvement but is complex.
   - Model 3: `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1)` achieves low MSE with moderate complexity. It represents a Langmuir-type isotherm.
   - Model 4: `c[0] + c[1]*x1/(c[2] + x1)` also achieves low MSE. It adds a constant term to Model 3, offering flexibility.

4. **Suggestions for New Models:**
   - To minimize complexity and MSE, consider modifying existing successful models or trying slightly different structures.
   - Avoid SR-similar models. 

5. **Potential New Models:**
   - One variation could be adding or subtracting a constant to a successful denominator structure.
   - Another idea is to explore combinations of linear and rational terms.

Based on these considerations, here are three new potential models:

1. `c[0]/(1 + c[1]*x1)`: This model simplifies to a form that could capture the saturation effect with fewer terms.
2. `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + c[2]*x1)`: A slight variation on the successful models that could capture non-linearity with a different structure.
3. `(c[0] + c[1]*x1)/(1 + c[2]*x1)`: A hybrid of linear and rational terms to explore a new form....

      ...Scratch Pad:

1. Analyze Existing Equations:
   - The given equations are based on rational functions, which are well-suited for capturing saturation-like behavior in adsorption processes.
   - Current equations are:
     1. `c[0] + c[1]/x1`: Simple hyperbolic, high error but low complexity.
     2. `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)`: Langmuir isotherm-like, much lower error.
     3. `c[0]*(x1+c[1])/(c[2]+x1)`: Extended version of Langmuir, slightly better.
     4. `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]/x1`: Sum of Langmuir and hyperbolic, best fit among given.

2. Consider New Forms:
   - Try to propose something with different structures but still capturing saturation or limiting behavior.
   - Avoid SR-similar forms like `c0/x1` or `c0*x1/(c1+x1)` with variations simply in constants.

3. New Proposals:
   - Start with combinations of linear and rational forms, while keeping complexity low.
   - Consider forms like `c[0] + c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)` which introduce a multiplicative factor.
   - Use subtraction or a different combination of terms to vary behavior.

4. Equation Ideas:
   - `c[0] * (x1 / (c[1] + x1)) - c[2]`: Introduces a subtractive constant, diverging from additions.
   - `c[0] * x1 / (c[1] + x1) + c[2] * x1`: Combines saturation with a linear term.
   - `c[0] / (x1 + c[1])`: Reverse form of a hyperbolic function, to introduce d...

The dataset exhibits a decreasing trend in the dependent variable, y, as the independent variable, x1, increases. The previous equations suggest a pattern involving rational expressions, indicating a possible saturation behavior or Langmuir-type isotherm where loading increases with pressure but eventually levels off.

1. The simplest equation provided is `c[0]+c[1]/x1`, which has the highest MSE. It suggests an inverse relation which doesn't fit well given the high error.

2. The equation `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)` has a moderate complexity and a significantly lower MSE. It represents a saturation curve, which fits the adsorption process well.

3. Adding a constant, as in `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]`, slightly improves the fit but increases complexity.

4. The equations `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1)` and `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1` suggest a combination of two saturation processes or a linear term, which further reduces the error but at the cost of increased complexity.

5. The best existing equation in terms of MSE is `c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)-c[3]*x1`, which has a good trade-off between complexity and accuracy.

To suggest new equations, we should aim for expressions that are diverse and not SR-similar to the provided ones....
