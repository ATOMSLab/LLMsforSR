We notice that expressions of the form `c[0]/(c[1]+x1)` and `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)` are quite effective with low complexity.

  2. Observations:\n   - Many of the existing equations utilize rational functions, which seem to be effective.\n   
  - The lowest complexity equation has a high mse, while the most complex ones have lower mse.\n   
  - We need to avoid expressions that are SR-similar to the above, focusing on different structures.\n\n

  - Explore combinations of terms that might mimic adsorption processes, such as Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms without making 
  them SR-similar.\n\n
  4. Potential New Structures:\n   
  - Try structures that involve combinations of terms like c0*x1 - c1/(c2 + x1), which is different from existing ones.\n   
  - Consider a form like c0 - c1*x1/(c2 + x1) where subtraction is used to introduce diversity.\n
