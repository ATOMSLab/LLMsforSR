A linear transformation of x1 might fit. So, an expression like y = c0 * x1 + c1 might capture the linear component.\n3. Given the behavior of y, which appears to decrease non-linearly, a simple rational function of the form y = c0 / x1 + c1 could also be appropriate.\n4. Another plausible form could be a polynomial or a combination of terms. Given the simplicity constraint, a quadratic y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2 might be too complex without fitting constants, but it is worth considering.",
