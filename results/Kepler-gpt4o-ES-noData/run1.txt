  Typically, in planetary systems, the semi-major axis might follow a pattern similar to that predicted by Kepler's laws, such as a square root or 
  a power law relationship. However, given the restrictions to only basic operations and square roots, and not fitting constants directly but using 
  placeholders like c0, c1, etc., we need to find simple yet effective expressions.\n\n1. A linear relationship y = c0 * x1 + c1 could be a starting

  grows with diminishing returns.\n3. A quadratic relationship y = c0 * x1**2 + c1 * x1 + c2 could capture more curvature if present.\n\nThese

Incorporate division to model any potential inverse relationships, e.g., `c[0]/(x1 + c[1])`. This could capture phenomena where the effect decreases with an increasing index.\n2. Consider a combination of linear and square root terms, e.g., `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1)`. This could capture any nonlinear growth patterns.\n3. Explore non-linear terms with divisions, e.g., `c[0]*x1/(x1 + c[1])`.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Analysis of Complexity and MSE:**\n   - Lower complexity implies a simpler model, but it might not capture the data well.\n   - Lower MSE implies better fit to the data.\n\n2. **Current Pareto Front Observations:**\n   - The lowest complexity (5) model is `c[0]*x1+c[1]` with high MSE.\n   - The lowest MSE (46.68860689) model is `c[0]*x1*sqrt(x1)` with complexity 6.\n   - Models with reasonable complexity (10-12) have MSE ranging from 374.77251611 to 847.34155246.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n   - Suggest new equations with minimized complexity and improved fit.\n   - Ensure diversity in the expressions to explore different functional forms.\n\n4. **Potential New Equation Forms:**\n   - Consider using combinations of `x1`, `x1**2`, `sqrt(x1)`, and division by expressions involving `x1`.\n   - Ensure that new forms are not SR-similar to existing ones by avoiding simple transformations or consolidations of existing terms.\n\n5. **Potential New Forms:**\n   - `c[0]/(x1 + c[1])`: Simple inverse relation, potentially providing a good balance.\n   - `c[0]*x1**2 / (c[1] + sqrt(x1))`: Combines polynomial and root, not SR-similar to existing.\n   - `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1**2)`: Offers a rational expression with different structure.",
