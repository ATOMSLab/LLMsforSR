The dataset provides a relation between the planet index (x1) and the semi-major axis (y). 
  Typically, in planetary systems, the semi-major axis might follow a pattern similar to that predicted by Kepler's laws, such as a square root or 
  a power law relationship. However, given the restrictions to only basic operations and square roots, and not fitting constants directly but using 
  placeholders like c0, c1, etc., we need to find simple yet effective expressions.

1. A linear relationship y = c0 * x1 + c1 could be a starting 
  point for capturing a basic trend.
2. A square root relationship y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1 might capture more complex relationships if the data 
  grows with diminishing returns.
3. A quadratic relationship y = c0 * x1**2 + c1 * x1 + c2 could capture more curvature if present.

These 
    expressions will allow us to capture various potential patterns in the data using simple algebraic formulas....

1. Observation: The semi-major axis of planets tends to follow a non-linear pattern as a function of their index in the solar system. This is often approximated by a power law or a logarithmic relationship.

2. Kepler's Third Law suggests that periods of planets are related to their semi-major axes, and historically, expressions like Titius-Bode law have been used, which suggests exponential-like growth (albeit empirical and not physically derived).

3. Considering the constraints:
   - We can use basic arithmetic operations and square root.
   - We must use placeholders for constants, like c0, c1, etc.

4. Common patterns to try:
   - Linear relationship with a scaling factor: c0 * x1 + c1
   - Quadratic or other polynomial forms: c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2
   - A form that introduces a square root could account for diminishing returns: c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1
   - Reciprocal or inverse forms could be considered if we notice diminishing or hyperbolic-like growth: c0 / x1 + c1

5. General Observations:
   - Higher indexed planets tend to have larger semi-major axes.
   - The growth is not purely linear, suggesting more complex terms like sqrt(x1) or x1^2.

Potential Expressions:

  1. Initial Observations:
   - The dataset involves planetary indices and semi-major axes.
  
   - Based on planetary system dynamics (Kepler's laws), semi-major axes often have specific patterns or relationships with indices.


   2. Simple Patterns:
   
   - Linear patterns: y = c0*x1 + c1
   
   - Quadratic patterns: y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2
   
   - Inverse patterns: y = c0/x1 + c1
   
   - Root patterns: y = c0*sqrt(x1) + c1


   3. Considering the operators allowed:
   
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root.
   
   - Avoid trigonometric or exponential functions.


   4. Potential Expressions:
   
   - Linear or affine transformations might be too simple unless the relationship is indeed linear.
   
   - Quadratic might fit if there's a parabolic trend.
   
   - Inverse might work if there's a hyperbolic pattern.
   
   - Square root might fit if the relationship is sub-linear.


   5. Possible Equations:
   
   - y = c0*x1 + c1 (simple linear)
   
   - y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2 (quadratic relation)
   
   - y = c0/x1 + c1 (hyperbolic type)
   
   - y = c0*sqrt(x1) + c1 (square root relat...
