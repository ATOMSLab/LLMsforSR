  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Let's review the patterns in the provided equations:\n   - The complexity ranges from 3 to 17.\n   - The Mean Squared Error (mse) decreases as the complexity increases, which is expected.\n   - The best equation in terms of mse among those provided is 'c[0]*x1**2/sqrt(x1)+c[1]*x1-c[2]*sqrt(x1)' with the lowest mse of 3.0617294.\n\n2. To suggest new equations, we will balance between complexity and mse by exploring different combinations of the existing operators and structures.\n\n3. Analyzing the best-performing equations:\n   - Polynomial terms: x1, x1**2\n   - Rational terms: 1/x1 and using divisions\n   - Square root terms: sqrt(x1)\n\n4. Creating diverse expressions:\n   - We will explore combinations of linear, quadratic, and square root terms, but avoid SR-similar structures.\n   - Aim for expressions with moderate complexity, around 10-12, since these perform well in the provided list but aren't overly complex.\n\n5. Suggestions:\n   - Consider using a combination of terms seen in lower complexity expressions to achieve a balance.\n   - Introduce new combinations of operators and terms that have not been used together in the provided equations.",
