  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Analyze existing equations:\n   - The simplest equation is `'c[0]*x1'`, which has a complexity of 3 and an MSE of 31135.22.\n   - The most complex one is `'c[0]+c[1]/(c[2]+x1)+c[3]*x1/(c[4]+x1)'` with a complexity of 15 and an MSE of 21728.92.\n   - A balance between complexity and loss can be seen in `'c[0]*x1/(c[1]-x1)'` with a complexity of 7 and an MSE of 29704.13.\n\n2. Patterns and strategies:\n   - Polynomials: These equations, like `'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1+c[2]*x1*x1*x1'`, offer a general form that's flexible but can result in high complexity.\n   - Rational expressions: Utilizing divisions can help capture asymptotic behaviors, seen in `'c[0]*x1+c[1]/(c[2]+x1)'`.\n   - Combinations of terms: Mixing polynomials and rational forms can capture more complex relationships, as seen in the expression with complexity 15.\n\n3. New equation suggestions:\n   - Given the nature of the data (cosmological distances and velocities), a linear term could be essential, but adding more complexity might involve mixing different forms, e.g., rational terms, to capture non-linear relationships.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions: This means considering how constants are distributed and how different forms can be combined to offer diverse predictions.\n\n4. Potential new equations:\n   - Try simpler polynomial forms combined with rational components.\n   - Consider using division by `(x1 + constant)` more creatively to introduce non-linearity with modest complexity.\n   - Explore possibilities of cross terms, such as `x1 / (x1 + constant)` or higher-order terms like `x1^2` with divisions.\n\nProposed New Equations:\n1. A combination of linear and inverse terms: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]/(x1 + c[2])`\n2. A rational expression with a squared term: `c[0]*x1/(x1 + c[1]) + c[2]*x1**2`\n3. An inverse quadratic form: `c[0]/(x1**2 + c[1]*x1 + c[2])`",
