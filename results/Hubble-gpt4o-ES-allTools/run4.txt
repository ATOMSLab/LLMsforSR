The previous models suggest polynomial and rational forms might be suitable for capturing this relationship, with varying complexities and mean squared errors (MSE).\n\n2.

The challenge is to propose new models that balance complexity with accuracy. We shall aim to keep complexity below or equal to the highest in the given list (complexity 17), while trying to maintain or improve the MSE.\n\n4. A rational function form like \"(c[0] + c[1]*x1) / (c[2] + x1)\" seems promising, as it allows for asymptotic behavior, which can be relevant in cosmology.\n\n5. A combination of linear and inverse terms, such as \"c[0]*x1 + c[1]/(x1 + c[2])\", is also promising for capturing different scales of variation.\n\n6. A polynomial form with a mix of linear, quadratic, and inverse terms, such as \"c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1**2/(x1 + c[3])\", might offer a good balance of fit and complexity.\n\n7.
