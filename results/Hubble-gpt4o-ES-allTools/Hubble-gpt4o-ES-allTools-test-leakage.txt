      ...Scratch Pad:
To approximate the given dataset, we'll look for patterns and relationships between the independent variable x1 (proper distance) and the dependent variable y (speed of separation). 
  We can see this is related to Hubble's law, which suggests a linear relationship between distance and speed, 
  but we also notice some non-linear behavior as x1 increases. 

Let's explore potential forms:
1. Linear form: y = c0 * x1. This simple linear relation might capture the basic trend expected from Hubble's law.
2. Quadratic form: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2. This adds a non-linear component which might better fit the mid-range of the data where speed increases more rapidly.
3. Rational form: y = c0 / x1 + c1 * x1. This form considers an inverse relation for small x1 values and a linear term for large x1 values.
   
Now, let's write these potential expressions....

      ...Scratch Pad:

1. **Understanding the Dataset**:
   - The dataset is about cosmology. The independent variable `x1` is the proper distance to a galaxy, and the dependent variable `y` is its speed of separation.
   - This suggests that there might be a relationship similar to Hubble's Law, where the speed of a galaxy is proportional to its distance, but given the dataset could be more complex.

2. **Initial Observations**:
   - The values of `y` range from negative to positive, indicating that the relationship might not be linear.
   - `x1` values are relatively small, and the values of `y` are significantly larger, indicating possible multiplication or division by a constant.

3. **Possible Simple Expressions**:
   
  - Linear expression: `y = c0 * x1` (basic relationship, akin to Hubble's Law).
   - Quadratic expression: `y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2` (to capture potential non-linear behavior).
   - Higher order or complex combinations: `y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 / x1` (introducing division to adjust for non-linear behavior).

4. **Balancing Complexity and Simplicity**:
   - Aim for expressions that capture the trend without overfitting.
   - Ensure expressions can account for both low and high values of `x1`.

5. **Selecting Expressions**:
   - Consider expressions that a...
