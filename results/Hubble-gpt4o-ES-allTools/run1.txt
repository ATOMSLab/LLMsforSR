This suggests a possible polynomial relationship or a rational function.\n2. The behavior of `y` suggests it might be quadratic or cubic in terms of `x1`, as the increase is not uniform.\n3. The data has fluctuations, so a simple linear model might not capture the complexity. However, a combination of linear and non-linear terms could be effective.\n4. A rational function, such as a ratio of polynomials, might capture the non-linearities effectively without overfitting.\n\nPotential expressions:\n- A quadratic polynomial: `y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2`\n- A cubic polynomial: `y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1^3`\n- A rational function: `y = (c0 * x1 + c1) / (c2 + x1)`\n\nThese expressions are chosen to balance between fitting the data and maintaining simplicity.",

Consider simple polynomial or rational expressions that aren't too complex but capture the non-linear behavior seen in the dataset.\n\n2. Avoid using expressions that are SR-similar to those already listed. We need to think of new forms that provide a different perspective on the relationship.\n\nPotential candidates:\n- A simple rational expression that introduces a different denominator form or combines terms differently.\n- An expression that leverages polynomial terms but in a unique configuration.\n- Consider balance between polynomial degree and rational terms to create diversity.\n\nGiven restrictions and goals, the suggested expressions could be:\n\n1. A rational expression with a different polynomial degree or arrangement.\n2. A polynomial expression that incorporates x1 in a novel structure.\n3. A mixed expression that combines both ideas above.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe goal is to suggest new equations that balance complexity with a good fit (low MSE). The equations provided in the list have varying levels of complexity and MSE. To generate new suggestions, examine the patterns and trends in both the data and existing equations.\n\n1. Dataset Analysis:\n   - The dataset seems to describe a cosmological phenomenon where the speed of separation (y) is related to the proper distance (x1) to a galaxy.\n   - Data shows a non-linear relationship; hence, polynomial or rational functions might be appropriate.\n   - The speed of separation increases with the proper distance, indicating a possible polynomial relationship with positive coefficients for higher-order terms.\n\n2. Current Equations Analysis:\n   - Most equations involve polynomial expressions in the numerator and denominators.\n   - Many equations use rational forms like `(c[0]*x1^n + ...) / (c[1]*x1^m + ...)` which can help linearize complex relationships.\n   - Complexity ranges from 7 to 23 with MSE from 28633 to 22816.\n\n3. Pattern Recognition:\n   - Lower complexity equations (around 7) have higher MSE.\n   - Higher complexity equations (up to 23) have lower MSE, but aim to balance.\n\n4. Suggestion Strategy:\n   - Explore expressions with slightly different polynomial degree combinations.\n   - Consider simpler polynomial forms for diversity.\n   - Maintain equation diversity by varying the degree of polynomial terms.\n\n5. Upcoming Suggestions:\n   - Consider simpler but diverse rational expressions.\n   - Explore different polynomial combinations.\n   - Avoid SR-similar equations.",
