The dataset is about isobutane adsorbing onto silicalite at a constant temperature. The Pareto front provided consists of equations with different complexity and accuracy levels. The goal is to suggest 3 new equations that minimize both complexity and loss while ensuring diversity.\n\nIn order to suggest diverse equations, we need to make sure that we don't propose SR-similar expressions. SR-similarity means that two expressions are considered similar if they can be transformed into each other by fitting the constants. For instance, the equations - c0/(x1-c1) & c0/(x1+c1) are SR-similar because the sign of a constant can be absorbed after fitting. Similarly, x1*(c0+c1) & x1*c0 are SR-similar because c0 and c1 can be consolidated into one fitted constant.\n\nUpon examining the provided equations, we can see a range of complexities from 3 to 29 and mean squared errors from 97.05857706 to 0.0004908. The simplest expression is x1/c[0] with a mean squared error of 0.62575857 and the most complex one is c[0]*x1**5+c[1]*x1**4+c[2]*x1**3+c[3]*x1**2+c[4]*x1+c[5] with a mean squared error of 97.05857706.

Given the restrictions and previous equations, we need to find new expressions that are not SR-similar to the ones already suggested.\n\nLooking at the provided Pareto front, the equations with the lowest mse have a relatively high complexity. Conversely, those with low complexity have a higher mse. \n\nThe simplest equation with the best mse is 'c[0]*x1+c[1]', but introducing a division can potentially improve mse at the cost of complexity. \n\nSince the dataset is about pressure and loading, it is reasonable to assume that the loading (y) would increase with increasing pressure (x1) until a certain limit (saturation), after which the loading would remain constant. This behavior is typically modeled by a hyperbolic function or a logistic function. However, given the restrictions, we can't use complex unary operators like exponentials, so a logistic function is out of the question.\n\nA hyperbolic function can be modeled as 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)', which is already in the list but has a relatively high mse. \n\nWe can introduce some variations of this function to see if we can improve mse without increasing complexity too much.\n\nWe can also experiment with adding another term to the equation, such as 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1 + c[2])'. This adds a degree of freedom to the fit, which might help reduce mse. \n\nFinally, we could attempt a combination of addition and division, such as '(c[0]*x1 + c[1])/(c[2]+x1)'.
