However, given the constraints on the types of operators we can use, we cannot directly apply these models. \n\nInstead, we need to look for simpler mathematical relationships. The simplest relationship could be a linear one, y = c0*x1 + c1. However, adsorption processes are typically non-linear. A slightly more complex model could be a quadratic equation, y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2. \n\nConsidering that the pressure/loading relationship might not be perfectly quadratic, a cubic relationship might be an alternate model for this data, y = c0*x1^3 + c1*x1^2 + c2*x1 + c3. \n\nFinally, a rational function might be a good fit as well, y = (c0*x1 + c1) / (c2*x1 + c3), this type of function can model a variety of relationships, including those that asymptotically approach a limit as x1 increases.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided Pareto front, it's clear that lower complexity models have higher errors, while higher complexity models have lower errors. This is expected as more complex models tend to fit the data more accurately. However, we can also see that beyond a certain point, increasing complexity doesn't lead to a significant reduction in error. For example, the model with complexity 17 only has a slightly lower mean squared error (mse) than the model with complexity 11. \n\nThe optimal model seems to be the one with complexity 11 and mse 0.00117965. This model has a reasonable balance between complexity and accuracy. It uses a division operation which is not present in the simpler models, suggesting that the relationship between the variables might not be purely additive or multiplicative. \n\nGiven these observations, my suggested equations would be based on a combination of addition, multiplication and division operations. They would also be of medium complexity to balance between accuracy and simplicity. \n\nI would avoid suggesting similar expressions to the ones already in the Pareto front to ensure diversity.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven that the data is about isobutane adsorbing onto silicalite at constant temperature, where the independent variable (x1) is pressure, and the dependent variable (y) is loading, we should focus on equations that have a physical interpretation in this context. \n\nThe least complex equation from the Pareto front is a simple linear equation 'c[0]*x1'. This equation suggests that there is a direct linear relationship between pressure and loading. However, the mean square error (MSE) for this equation is relatively high, suggesting that this equation may not fit the data well.\n\nThe equation with the lowest MSE is '(c[0]*x1+c[1])/(c[2]*x1+c[3])'. Although this equation has a relatively low complexity of 11, it might be too complex for this dataset. \n\nWe can try to propose new equations that balance the trade-off between complexity and MSE. The complexity of the equation increases as we add more terms and use higher powers of x1. We should also avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions to avoid redundant expressions.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can propose the following three equations:\n1. A linear equation with an inverse term: 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]/x1'. This equation suggests that the relationship between pressure and loading is influenced both by the pressure itself and its inverse. This equation has a complexity of 5.\n2. A quadratic equation: 'c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*x1'. This equation suggests that the relationship between pressure and loading could be quadratic.
