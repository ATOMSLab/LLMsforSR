  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nIn astrophysics, Kepler's laws describe the motion of planets around the sun. The 3rd law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Therefore, the expressions will likely involve a cube and square root operation. \n\nSince we are trying to describe a relation between x1 (semi-major axis) and y (period), and y^2 is proportional to x1^3, it's reasonable to express y in terms of the square root of x1 cubed, multiplied by a constant. We are allowed to use constants c0, c1, etc.\n\nSince only five operators (+, -, *, /, sqrt) are allowed, we can also try simple expressions including these operators. However, considering the nature of the problem, it's unlikely that simple addition, subtraction, or division will provide a good fit.\n\nTherefore, the three expressions I propose are as follows:\n\n1) y = c0 * sqrt(x1^3)\n2) y = sqrt(c0 * x1^3)\n3) y = c0 * sqrt(c1 * x1^3)",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided equations, they all seem to follow a similar pattern of raising 'x1' to the power of 3, then taking the square root after multiplying by a constant. This pattern is likely due to the Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nHowever, as per the constraints, we need to suggest equations that are not SR-similar to the above ones, and they should also be of relatively low complexity. So we can consider variations of the above pattern to fulfill these criteria.\n\nFirst, we can drop the square root operation, which reduces the complexity. Secondly, we can multiply 'x1' to the power of 3 with different powers of 'c0'. Lastly, we can also consider dividing 'x1' to the power of 3 by a constant 'c0' rather than multiplying.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the results of the previous regressions and the constraints given, it's clear that we have a strong relationship between the cubic power of the semi-major axis and the period, which is consistent with Kepler's third law of planetary motion. The results also indicate that taking the square root of this relationship significantly improves the model's accuracy. Given these insights, the challenge is to generate new, diverse expressions that are still relatively simple and potentially improve upon the existing models. Considering all these factors, I will suggest the following equations:\n\n1. c0 * x1 / sqrt(x1): This equation introduces a division operation and combines it with the square root operation. The complexity here is still relatively low.\n\n2. sqrt(c0 * x1): This equation simplifies the relationship further by applying the square root operation directly to the product of the constant and the semi-major axis.\n\n3. (c0 / x1) * sqrt(c0 * x1): This equation introduces a division operation and combines it with the square root operation. It's a bit more complex than the other two but might provide better accuracy.",

The MSE decreases as the equations become more complex, but this might lead to overfitting. We need to find a balance between low complexity and low MSE.\n\nThere are some constraints that we need to consider. We are limited to five operators (+, -, *, /, sqrt()) and we can't fit constants, but use c0, c1, etc. We also have to avoid SR-similar expressions.\n\nWe should come up with diverse equations that are not SR-similar to the ones we already have. This means we should avoid equations that are equivalent to the current ones after fitting the constants. For example, if we have c0*x1**3, we should not suggest c1*x1**3, because it's essentially the same equation with a different constant.\n\nWe can experiment with different combinations of operators and polynomials of x1. For example, we can take the square root of a sum of cubes, or divide a cube by a square. We can also add or subtract terms to add diversity.",
