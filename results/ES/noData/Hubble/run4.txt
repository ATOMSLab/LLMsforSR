We also need to avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions.\n\nFrom the given Pareto front, we can see that the expressions are a combination of multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction operations on the variable x1 and the constants c0, c1, c2, and c3.\n\nConsidering the above constraints and observations, it seems beneficial to explore expressions that involve both multiplication and division, as they tend to provide lower MSE values. Also, we can experiment with different powers of x1 and varying the number of constants to find a balance between complexity and accuracy.\n\nFollowing these guidelines, three new expressions can be suggested as follows:\n\n1. An expression with complexity 3 using one constant and the variable x1, similar to the first equation from the Pareto front but with a division operation instead of multiplication.\n\n2.
