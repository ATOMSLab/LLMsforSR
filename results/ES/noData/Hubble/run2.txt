Adding inverse relation, \"c[0]*x1-c[1]/x1\", and quadratic relation, \"c[0]*x1-c[1]*x1**2\", significantly improves the error with a small increase in complexity. Further adding both inverse and quadratic terms, \"c[0]*x1-c[1]*x1**2+c[2]/x1\", yields a slight improvement in error but a significant increase in complexity.\n\nSince adding inverse and quadratic terms has been successful, the new expressions should also include these elements but in a different manner to avoid redundancy.
