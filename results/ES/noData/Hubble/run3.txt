Given the constraints of the task, it seems reasonable to try and construct equations that are novel yet adhere to the required complexity and simplicity. \n\nGiven that the dataset is about physical cosmology and the relationship between proper distance to a galaxy (x1) and its speed of separation (y), it is important to keep in mind the context. Cosmological phenomena often exhibit linear, quadratic, or inverse relationships, which is reflected in the equations given.\n\nThe equations provided suggest a relationship between x1 and y that is either proportional, inversely proportional, or quadratic in nature. \n\nConsidering the simplicity, complexity, and the physical context, we can create three new equations that could potentially fit the data. \n\n1. A simple linear equation with no constant term. This equation has the lowest complexity but may not provide the best fit.\n\n2. A rational equation with x1 in the denominator. This would provide a good fit if the data follows an inverse relationship.\n\n3. A quadratic equation with a negative x1 squared term. This would provide a good fit if the data follows a quadratic relationship.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided equations, there is a pattern of increasing complexity and reducing mean squared error (MSE). However, the goal is to find equations that balance complexity and accuracy, as well as provide diverse solutions. \n\nThe current equations all use either subtraction (-) or division (/). To provide diversity, we can propose equations using addition (+) or multiplication (*), and combinations of these operators. \n\nAdditionally, the current equations only use constants up to c[1]. To further diversify, we can propose equations that use c[2]. \n\nFinally, we need to avoid SR-similar expressions, so we need to ensure the equations are not just a reordering or simple transformation of existing equations. \n\nBased on these observations, possible new equations could be: \n1. c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1\n2. c[0]*x1*x1 + c[1]\n3. c[0]*x1*(c[1]+c[2]*x1)",
