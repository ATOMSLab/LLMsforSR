It's likely that the semi-major axis grows with the planet index, so we might expect a positive relationship.\n\n1. A simple linear relationship might be an initial consideration. However, considering the nature of the data (planetary system), a simple linear model might not capture the complexity of the data. An expression of this form could be y = c0 * x1 + c1.\n\n2. A polynomial expression might be more appropriate to capture non-linear trends. A quadratic expression of the form y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2 could be a good candidate for the second expression.\n\n3. As another option, an exponential growth model might be suitable as planetary systems tend to exhibit exponential characteristics. An expression of this form could be y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1).",
