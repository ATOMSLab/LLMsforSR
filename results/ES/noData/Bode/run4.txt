The semi-major axis increases as the planet index increases, suggesting a possible relationship modeled by an exponential function or a polynomial function. \n\nIt's important to note that we are restricted to the +, -, *, /, ^ and exp operators. We also cannot fit constants, but must use c0, c1, etc. \n\nIn this case, it seems reasonable to start with a simple power relationship, as it can model exponential growth. This would be of the form y = c0*x1^c1. \n\nAnother possible relationship could be a polynomial of the form y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2. This would allow for nonlinear growth without the rapid increase of an exponential function.\n\nFinally, we can consider a simple linear relationship for comparison, of the form y = c0 + c1*x1. \n\nWe should keep in mind that these are approximations and may not perfectly fit the data.",
