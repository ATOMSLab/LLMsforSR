Both are common in adsorption studies. \n\nThe Langmuir isotherm model can be expressed as: y = (c0 * x1) / (1 + c1 * x1), where c0 is the maximum adsorption capacity and c1 is the Langmuir constant. \n\nThe Freundlich isotherm model can be expressed as: y = c0 * x1^(1/c1), which is not allowed in this case as we're restricted to only basic operators.\n\nHowever, we can try simplifying the Freundlich isotherm model expression to fit our requirement. We can consider y = c0 * x1/c1, but this is a simple linear model and might not fit well to the actual data.\n\nAnother possible model is a polynomial model, y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2. But since we're restricted to basic operators, we can simplify it to y = c0 + c1*x1 - c2/x1.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe Pareto front provided indicates a trade-off between accuracy (measured by mean squared error, mse) and complexity of the equations. Lower complexity and lower mse are desirable. The given equations vary in complexity from 3 to 11 and in mse from 0.12213021 to 46.17289256. \n\nThe objective is to suggest novel equations that are simpler (lower complexity) and more accurate (lower mse). However, the equations need to be diverse and not SR-similar to avoid redundancy.\n\nLooking at the equations, it seems that the use of division '/' and multiplication '*' results in good accuracy but at the cost of higher complexity. Addition '+' and subtraction '-' appear to produce less accurate but simpler equations. \n\nIn order to generate diverse equations, it's important to manipulate the operators and variables in different ways, while respecting the restrictions that no complex unary operators are allowed and only the independent variable x1 can be used. \n\nThe use of multiple constants (c0, c1, c2) can also introduce diversity in the equations. However, care must be taken to not introduce SR-similarity through the use of constants.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided equations, I can see that the dataset follows a trend where the complexity and mean squared error (MSE) are inversely proportional. As the complexity increases, the MSE decreases. This is a common trend in regression analysis, where adding more terms to the model can capture more details of the data, thus reducing the error.\n\nHowever, adding more terms also increases the risk of overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and starts to capture the noise in the data rather than the underlying trend. Therefore, we need to strike a balance between complexity and error.\n\nThe equations provided all involve either multiplication or division, or both, between the variable x1 and one or more constants. This suggests that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is not simply linear. \n\nIn addition, a common pattern I see among the equations with lower MSE is the use of division. This could be because the phenomenon being modeled has a rate that changes with the value of x1, which is captured by a division operation. \n\nGiven these observations, I can suggest three new equations that aim to strike a balance between complexity and MSE. These equations will involve both multiplication and division operations, with different combinations of the variable x1 and constants.",
