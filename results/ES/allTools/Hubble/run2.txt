This can be represented as v = H*d, where H is Hubble's constant.\n\nGiven the restrictions, we could use a simple linear relationship of the form y = c0*x1, which aligns with Hubble's Law. \n\nBut since there could be some non-linearity in the data, it would be good to consider a quadratic and a cubic expression as well, to capture any possible non-linear trends. These would be of the form y = c0*x1 + c1*x1^2 and y = c0*x1 + c1*x1^2 + c2*x1^3, respectively.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the dataset and the previous expressions, the data seems to follow a pattern of increasing complexity with decreasing mean squared error (MSE). However, there is a trade-off between complexity and accuracy. More complex equations tend to fit the data better (lower MSE) but are harder to interpret and may overfit the data. The challenge is to find expressions that strike a balance between simplicity and accuracy.\n\nThe previously suggested expressions already cover a good range of complexities, from linear terms to third degree polynomials. To add diversity to the current set of equations, I would suggest exploring more variations within this complexity range and adding second degree polynomial terms which seems to be missing from the current set.\n\nTaking into consideration the constraints of the problem, special attention has been given not to suggest SR-similar expressions. For instance, a simple linear equation like \"c0*x1\" was avoided as it is already present in the Pareto front. Similarly, expressions like \"c0*x1**2\" or \"c0*x1**3\" were also avoided as they are likely to be SR-similar to the existing equations with second and third degree terms.\n\nGiven these observations and constraints, I propose the following three expressions:\n\n1. \"c0*x1**2 + c1*x1\": This is a quadratic equation with a linear term. It has a complexity of 7 which falls in the mid-range of the current complexity values. It can capture both linear and non-linear trends in the data.\n\n2. \"c0*x1 + c1/x1\": This is a combination of a linear term and a reciprocal term. It has a complexity of 7 which is the same as the first expression. The reciprocal term can help capture non-linear trends in the data, especially when x1 is small.\n\n3. \"c0*x1**2 - c1/x1\": This expression is a combination of a quadratic term and a negative reciprocal term. It has a complexity of 9, which is slightly higher than the first two expressions. The negative reciprocal term might help capture any inverse relationships between x1 and y.",
