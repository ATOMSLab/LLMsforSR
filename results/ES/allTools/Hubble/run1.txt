Therefore, the first equation would be y = c0 * x1.\n\nAdditionally, we can try some polynomial expressions of x1, as the relationship might not be linear due to the effects of dark energy or other cosmological phenomena. So, the second equation could be y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2.\n\nLastly, we can add a third equation with a cubic term, which might better fit the data if there's a significant non-linearity.

It seems that the complexity and accuracy trade-off is favoring more complex models with lower error. However, given the restrictions, we need to come up with new non-polynomial expressions to bring diversity in the solution space.\n\nObserving the data, it seems there's an increasing trend. It suggests multiplicative models could be beneficial. Also, taking into account the physical context of the problem (proper distance to a galaxy and its speed of separation), it may be reasonable to consider ratios and differences.\n\nBased on these observations, here are a few expressions to try:\n\n1. A linear combination of x1 and its reciprocal: c0*x1 + c1*(1/x1) - it's a 7-complexity model that might capture the increasing trend and the possible influence of the reciprocal distance.\n\n2. A ratio of x1 to a constant plus x1: (c0*x1) / (c1 + x1) - it's a 7-complexity model that might capture the increasing trend and the possible influence of the distance.\n\n3.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven that the data is about physical cosmology where the independent variable (x1) is proper distance to a galaxy and the dependent variable (y) is its speed of separation, we can infer that as the distance increases, the speed of separation also increases. This suggests a positive correlation between the variables.\n\nLooking at the accuracy and complexity Pareto front provided, the equations with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) are those with higher complexity. It's also important to note that we are looking for equations that are not SR-similar to avoid redundancy.\n\nFor example, the equation with the lowest MSE is 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2+c[2]*x1**3+c[3]*x1**4' with a complexity of 21. This equation is a 4th degree polynomial, suggesting a non-linear relationship between the variables.\n\nHowever, we want to minimize both complexity and loss. Therefore, we can try to find equations that are simpler but still capture the trend in the data. Given the constraints (only +, -, *, and / operators allowed, no fitting constants, no SR-similar expressions), here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. c[0]*x1 + c[1]/x1: This equation suggests that the speed of separation is a function of the distance to the galaxy and its reciprocal. This type of relationship could make sense in a cosmological context, where distances are incredibly vast.\n\n2. x1/(c[0]+c[1]*x1): This equation is a bit more complex, suggesting that the speed of separation is inversely proportional to a linear function of the distance. This could capture possible saturation effects at very large distances.\n\n3. c[0]*x1 - c[1]/x1: Similar to the first equation, but here the speed of separation decreases as the reciprocal of the distance increases. This could capture possible slowdown effects at very large distances.",
