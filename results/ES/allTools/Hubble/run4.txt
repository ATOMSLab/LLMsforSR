Since the data is related to physical cosmology, the data could likely follow Hubble's law, which states that the speed of separation of a galaxy is proportional to its distance. This would imply a linear relationship between the variables. \n\nGiven the restrictions, the simplest model to start with would be a linear model of the form y = c0*x1. \n\nHowever, if the relationship is not exactly linear, we might need to include higher order terms. A quadratic equation can be considered, such as y = c0*x1 + c1*x1^2. \n\nA third equation to consider could be y = c0*x1 + c1/x1. This equation implies that the speed of separation increases with distance but at a decreasing rate.",

Firstly, the equations seem to be a combination of linear, inverse, and quadratic patterns. There are also some equations that include a cubic term. The MSE (Mean Squared Error) seems to decrease as the complexity of the equations increase, which suggests that a more complex model might be a better fit for the data.\n\nHowever, the challenge here is to find simpler models that still have a good fit. Also, we need to ensure that the new equations are not SR-similar to the ones already provided. Given these constraints, I suggest the following three equations:\n\n1.

We need to keep in mind the constraints of the problem, i.e., only basic mathematical operations are allowed, and we should aim for lower complexity and lower mean squared error.\n\nThe provided dataset contains an independent variable x1 which represents the proper distance to a galaxy and the dependent variable y which represents its speed of separation. Observing the given results, we can see an inverse relationship between complexity and mean squared error. As the complexity of the equation increases, the mean squared error decreases. However, we must strive to keep the complexity as low as possible while still achieving a low mean squared error.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, three new possible equations could be:\n1. A simple linear equation with a single coefficient: c[0]*x1**2\n2. A quadratic equation with two coefficients: c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*x1\n3. A cubic equation with three coefficients: c[0]*x1**3 + c[1]*x1**2 + c[2]*x1\n\nThese equations provide a good diversity and are simple enough to be well-fitted to the data.
