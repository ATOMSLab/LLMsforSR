  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "First, let's observe the relationship between x1 (pressure) and y (loading). The y-values seem to increase as the x-values increase, suggesting a direct relationship. However, the rate of increase appears to slow down as x gets larger. This might suggest a reciprocal relationship or a ratio, as these types of relationships often exhibit this kind of behavior.\n\nOne possible simple model could be a linear relationship between x1 and y with coefficients c0 and c1: y1 = c0 + c1*x1. However, this might not capture the diminishing returns seen in the data.\n\nAnother expression might be a ratio of x1 and a constant, which could capture the diminishing returns: y2 = x1 / (c2 + x1). The c2 constant could represent a sort of \"saturation point\" beyond which additional pressure doesn't result in as much additional loading.\n\nA third expression could be a combination of the two: y3 = (c3 + c4*x1) / (c5 + x1). This model combines elements of the previous two, capturing both the general increase in loading with pressure and the diminishing returns. The coefficients c3, c4, and c5 would need to be fitted to the data.",

We need to predict non-linear equations based on the dataset, satisfying the given conditions and minimizing both the complexity and loss. The complexity is based on the number of operators and operands in the equation. We should also avoid SR-similar expressions.\n\nThe given equation from the Pareto front is 'c[0]+c[1]*x1'. We can derive new equations by introducing division and subtraction operators, which are not present in the given equation, to ensure diversity. We can also use multiplication again, but in a different way to avoid SR-similar expressions.\n\nLet's consider the following expressions:\n\n1) c0*x1+c1\n2) c0/(x1+c1)\n3) c0-c1/x1 \n\nThe first equation is a simple linear equation where the dependent variable (y) is directly proportional to the independent variable (x1). This equation is an extension of the given equation from the Pareto front by swapping the constants. \n\nThe second equation introduces the division operator. This equation implies that the dependent variable (y) is inversely proportional to the independent variable (x1) when a constant (c1) is added to it.\n\nThe third equation introduces the subtraction operator. This equation implies that the dependent variable (y) is inversely proportional to the independent variable (x1) when it is subtracted from a constant (c0).\n\nThese expressions have a complexity of 5, similar to the given equation, but they provide diversity in terms of the operators used.",
