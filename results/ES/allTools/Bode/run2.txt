This suggests that our expressions should involve x1 raised to a power c1 or as the exponent in an exp function.\n\nThis is consistent with the Kepler's laws of planetary motion, where the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit (y) increases approximately as the cube of the planet's index (x1). However, here it seems to be following a different pattern, possibly due to the fact that we are not considering the sun's index as 0 (the value of y when x1 is 0 is not 0). \n\nWe can try different power terms and exponential functions to find the best fit.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the dataset, it seems like there might be an exponential relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The values of y are increasing at a rate that seems to be more than just linear or polynomial. This can be confirmed by the fact that the equation with the lowest mean squared error in the Pareto front is 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)'.\n\nThe current Pareto front already has a polynomial ('c[0]*x1**c[1]') and an exponential equation. To diversify, we can try adding a linear term to the exponential equation, or using a rational function. Additionally, we can also try different powers in the polynomial equation. \n\nThe restrictions allow us to use operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and exponential. However, we are not allowed to use complex unary operators like trigonometric functions. We also have to use constants named as 'c0', 'c1', and so forth, and we can only use the independent variables provided in the dataset. \n\nWe must also avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions. For example, '-c0/(x1-c1)' and 'c0/(x1+c1)' are considered SR-similar because the sign of the constant can be absorbed after fitting. Similarly, 'x1*(c0+c1)' and 'x1*c0' are SR-similar because c0 and c1 can be consolidated into one fitted constant. Similarly, 'c0/(x1*c1)' and 'c0/x1' are considered SR-similar because c0 and c1 can be consolidated into one fitted constant.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the data, a pattern of exponential increase is observed as x1 increases. The equations already provided, such as 'c[0]*x1*exp(c[1]*x1)', 'exp(c[0]*x1+c[1])' and 'exp(c[0]*x1)', seem to capture this trend well, but have relatively high complexity. \n\nTo reduce complexity while maintaining accuracy, one approach could be to simplify the existing equations by removing unnecessary components. For example, the equation 'c[0]*x1*exp(c[1]*x1)' could be simplified to 'x1*exp(c[0])', removing the need for the second constant and reducing the equation complexity from 8 to 4. \n\nAnother approach could be to combine the exponential and polynomial components of the current equations in different ways. For example, the equation 'c[0]*x1**2*exp(c[1]*x1)' combines a quadratic term (x1**2) with an exponential term (exp(c[1]*x1)). This could be simplified to 'x1**2*exp(c[0])', reducing the complexity from 10 to 5.\n\nFinally, we could look for ways to capture the exponential growth pattern using only a single term. For example, the equation 'exp(x1)' has low complexity (2) but relatively high mean square error (mse). This could be improved by raising x1 to a power, such as 'exp(x1^c[0])', which would increase complexity slightly (to 3) but could potentially improve accuracy.",

It is crucial to reduce complexity while keeping the error low. The task also emphasizes diversity, implying that the suggested equations should not be SR-similar to the ones already provided.
