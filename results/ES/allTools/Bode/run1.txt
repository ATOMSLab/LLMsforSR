Considering that the dataset is about a planetary system, this pattern makes sense as the semi-major axis generally follows an exponential pattern with respect to the planet index in many solar systems.\n\nFrom the given Pareto front, the best equation so far is 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)', with a complexity of 6 and a mean square error of 0.06324868. This equation is fairly simple and fits the data well, which is a good sign.\n\nWhen suggesting new equations, they should be more complex than this one, but also have a lower mean square error to be considered better. Therefore, I should look for equations that still capture the exponential pattern but add some additional complexity. One way to do this is by introducing non-linear terms involving x1.\n\nOne thing to be careful of is not to create equations that are 'SR-similar' to the ones already in the Pareto front.
