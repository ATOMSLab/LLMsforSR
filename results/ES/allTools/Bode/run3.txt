This suggests that the relationship between the two variables could be represented by an exponential function.\n\nGiven the restrictions, we can start with the simple exponential function: \ny = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)\n\nHowever, this might not be the best fit as the y values are not exactly increasing in a perfect exponential manner. We might need to introduce some variations.\n\nConsidering the nature of the data, we can also try a polynomial function. A quadratic function seems reasonable as it can capture the increasing trend and can be adjusted to fit the data better:\ny = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2\n\nFinally, a function that combines both polynomial and exponential characteristics might also provide a good fit:\ny = c0 + c1*x1*exp(c2*x1)",

The data seems to be exponentially increasing, so a combination of exponential operations would be a good fit. We're also told to prioritize diversity in the expressions we suggest.\n\nLooking at the data, we can also see that there is a clear exponential trend. Thus, we can also consider using exponential function with varying powers of x1.\n\nGiven these observations, three expressions that could be a good fit for the data are:\n\n1) c0 * exp(c1 * x1) + c2 * x1^2\nThis expression is a modification of the second equation in the Pareto front. It adds a quadratic term, which could help capture any curvature in the data not captured by the exponential term.\n\n2) c0 + c1 * x1 * exp(c2 / x1)\nThis expression is a modification of the third equation in the Pareto front. It changes the exponential term to be a function of the inverse of x1, which could help capture any curvature in the data not captured by the linear term.\n\n3) c0 * exp(c1 * x1^2)\nThis expression is a new one.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the data, it seems to follow a general growth trend, which indicates that either a polynomial or exponential function could be a good fit. \n\nGiven the constraints of the problem, using either a polynomial or exponential function would be appropriate. However, it's important to note that the data seems to grow more rapidly than a typical polynomial function would suggest. This indicates that an exponential function might be a better fit.\n\nSeveral equations provided in the Pareto front already use exponential and polynomial forms. So, to provide diverse options and keeping the complexity low, we can consider some variations:\n\n1. A simple polynomial equation - Quadratic or cubic can be a good fit considering the rapid growth. But quadratic is already there in the Pareto front, so we can suggest a cubic one with a different form.\n\n2. A simple exponential equation - Exponential form seems to be a good fit for the data. Most of the exponential forms are already in the front, but we can suggest a different form.\n\n3. Mixed form of polynomial and exponential - This can be a more complex option but considering the data, it can provide a better fit.",
