  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "The given dataset seems to follow the Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This means that we can expect a power law relationship between the two variables. Given the restrictions on the operators, we can use *, / and sqrt() to form the expressions. \n\nLooking at the dataset, it seems like the dependent variable y can be represented as a simple multiplication of a constant c0 and the independent variable x1 raised to the power 1.5. This follows the Kepler's Third Law as the square root of y would be proportional to x1 cubed. \n\nTwo alternative expressions could be a direct division of y by x1 or a division of y by the square root of x1. These expressions might not follow the Kepler's Third Law directly but they are based on simple mathematical transformations of the data using the allowed operators and can provide approximations of the relationship between the variables.",
