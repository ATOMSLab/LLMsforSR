However, given that the relationship in the data does not seem to be perfectly inverse (the decrease in y is not exactly proportional to the increase in x1), it might be more accurate to try a model that includes a linear term: y = c0 + c1/x1.\n\nFinally, since we are not restricted to using only one term in our models, I would also try a model that includes a quadratic term: y = c0 + c1/x1 + c2/x1^2.

  "LLM Thoughts": "The dataset shows a steady decline in the dependent variable (y) as the independent variable (x1) increases. This suggests a relationship where y decreases as x1 increases, which is a characteristic of a reciprocal or inverse relationship.\n\nLooking at the previous suggestions, it appears that the most accurate expressions involve the inverse of x1. This makes sense given the trend in the dataset. However, there is an opportunity to propose expressions with different structures to add diversity. \n\nIt's important to consider the restrictions. No complex unary operators are allowed and only four basic operators can be used (+, -, *, /). Also, only variables present in the data can be used. In this case, it's just x1. \n\nAlso, we need to avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions. This means we need to ensure that the expressions proposed are not similar to the ones already suggested once the constants are fitted, i.e., they should have different structures. \n\nGiven these considerations, here are my proposed expressions:\n\n1. c0 + c1*x1 - c2/x1\n2. c0/(c1 + x1)\n3. c0*x1/(c1 + x1)",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe dataset shows the loading of nitrogen onto mica as a function of pressure. The equations provided show a trend of the dependent variable decreasing as the independent variable increases. All of the equations contain division, suggesting a potential inverse relationship between the variables.\n\nThe first equation, 'c[0]/x1', is the simplest with a complexity of 3, but it also has the highest mean squared error (mse) at 310.24145142. The equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1+c[2])' has a relatively lower complexity of 9 and much lower mse of 0.12263081.\n\nLooking at the restrictions and the provided equations, we can generate three new equations that minimize both complexity and loss. We aim to create equations that are diverse, but still follow the trend of the dataset and meet the restrictions.\n\nWe can also consider the physical process involved, which is adsorption. Adsorption often follows an inverse relationship between pressure and loading, which is reflected in the provided equations. Based on this, we can generate equations that keep this inverse relationship while varying the complexity.",
