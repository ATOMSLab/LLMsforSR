While keeping complexity in check, I also need to ensure that the new expressions are not SR-similar to the existing ones.\n\nI am considering the following expressions:\n\n1. A simple division operation: c0/(c1*x1). This expression has a complexity of 5. In this case, I am multiplying the divisor x1 with another constant c1. This is a simple modulation of the expression 'c[0]/x1' from the Pareto front, but not SR-similar to it.\n\n2. A combination of division and multiplication: c0*x1/(c1*x1). This expression has a complexity of 7. Here, I am using a division operation and introducing a multiplication operation in the numerator. This is not SR-similar to any of the existing equations.\n\n3. A combination of multiplication and subtraction: c0*x1 - c1. The complexity of this expression is 5. This expression is distinct as it does not involve any division operation. It's a basic linear equation, and none of the current equations in the Pareto front are SR-similar to it.",
