  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided dataset, it is apparent that the relationship between y and x1 is non-linear. The values of y are increasing at an increasing rate as x1 increases.\n\nThe current Pareto front contains four equations with complexities ranging from 5 to 17 and mean squared error (MSE) ranging from 14.35 to 1123634.7. The equation with the least complexity has the highest MSE, and the equation with the highest complexity has the least MSE. This indicates a trade-off between complexity and accuracy.\n\nTo suggest 3 new equations, we first need to analyze the existing equations. The current equations use the operators +, *, and sqrt(), and the power of x1 varies from 1 to 3. To introduce diversity, we can consider using the operator / and different combinations of +, -, *, and sqrt().\n\nConsidering the restrictions and the need for diversity, we can consider the following equations:\n\n1. An equation with a single term using the / operator: c0/x1\n2. An equation with two terms using different operators: c0*x1 - c1*sqrt(x1)\n3. An equation with three terms using different operators: c0*x1**2 - c1/x1 + c2\n\nThese equations have varying complexity and offer a range of models from simple to complex.

The first is that the mean squared error (MSE) tends to decrease as the complexity of the equation increases. This is to be expected, as more complex equations can fit the data more accurately at the cost of interpretability. \n\nIn terms of the specific forms of the equations, we can see that the division operator tends to yield higher MSE values than the multiplication operator. This could suggest that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is more multiplicative than fractional. \n\nThe square root operator also seems to yield lower MSE values, suggesting that there may be a root relationship between the dependent and independent variables. \n\nTaking these observations into account, we can suggest new equations that incorporate the multiplication and square root operators, while minimizing complexity. \n\nFirst equation: A simple equation that includes both the multiplication and square root operators is \"sqrt(x1)*c[0]\".

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the data, I notice that the dependent variable y increases as the independent variable x1 increases. This suggests that the relationship might involve positive powers of x1, possibly a polynomial. \n\nGiven the constraints, however, I'm limited to using only the five basic operations, and I can't use complex unary operators or fit constants. \n\nTaking into account the MSE and complexity of the previously suggested models, I can see that the equation 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1' has a low MSE and relatively low complexity. However, it involves a square and a linear term, which might be more complex than necessary.\n\nTo reduce complexity, I will try creating expressions that involve only linear and square root terms. The square root function tends to reduce the range of the dependent variable, which might help to reduce the MSE.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I will suggest the following three equations:\n\n1. c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*x1\n2. c[0]*x1 + c[1]/sqrt(x1)\n3. c[0]*x1 - c[1]*sqrt(x1)\n\nThese equations should provide a balance between complexity and accuracy, and they are diverse in the sense that they combine the basic operators in different ways.",
