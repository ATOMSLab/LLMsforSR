This is also confirmed with the low MSE values of the previously suggested inverse equations. We can explore more variations of this inverse relationship.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the restrictions on complexity and strive for diverse solutions. Looking at the Pareto front given, we can see that a quadratic equation also achieved a low MSE, so we can also explore variations of this.\n\nFor the new equation suggestions, let's try to come up with one simple inverse equation, one quadratic equation, and one that combines these two concepts.\n\n1. Simple inverse equation: y = c0 / (c1 * x1)\nThis is a variation of the inverse relationship, but by multiplying x1 with a constant, we can adjust the rate of decrease.\n\n2. Quadratic equation: y = c0 + c1 * x1**2\nThis equation is similar to the one in the Pareto front, but without the linear term. This will allow the quadratic term to fully determine the shape of the function.\n\n3. Combination of inverse and quadratic: y = c0 / (c1 * x1**2)\nThis equation combines the two concepts and allows for a more complex relationship where the decrease in y as x1 increases is not constant but accelerates.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nThe given dataset consist of one dependent variable and one independent variable. The goal is to find new equations that are less complex and have a lower mean squared error. Looking at the Pareto front, it is evident that simpler equations have a higher MSE while more complex equations have a lower MSE. The equation with the least complexity has the highest MSE while the equation with the highest complexity has the lowest MSE. This is expected, as a more complex model can capture the nuances of the data better, leading to a lower error. \n\nPossible equations can include the use of basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. While formulating the equations, it's important to remember to not include any complex unary operators and to use only the independent variable from the dataset.\n\nSome potential equations can include variations of the independent variable with the constants. For example, an equation can be formulated by multiplying the independent variable with a constant and then subtracting another constant. Another equation can involve dividing a constant by the independent variable and then adding another constant. Yet another equation can involve multiplying the independent variable with a constant and then dividing by another constant.\n\nAll these equations follow the given restrictions and are diverse, therefore likely to be helpful in the regression analysis.",
