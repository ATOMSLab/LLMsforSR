However, the relationship does not seem to be linear since the rate of decrease in y is not constant with the increase in x1. \n\nA simple linear regression model like y = c0 - c1*x1 might not provide a good fit for the data. We could try a polynomial regression model like y = c0 - c1*x1^2, but according to the instructions, no exponentials are permitted. \n\nSo, we will have to use a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get the best approximation. \n\nGiven the decreasing relationship and the constraints, three potential models could be:\n\n1. y = c0 - c1*x1\n2. y = c0 - c1/x1\n3. y = (c0 - x1)/c1",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the current equations, there are a few patterns to note. Two of the equations feature a division operation with x1 in the denominator, and one equation has x1 in the numerator. All equations have a complexity between 5 to 9 and mean squared error (mse) between 0.122 and 3.382.\n\nNew equations should maintain this complexity range and strive for a lower mse. They should also be diverse compared to the existing ones and not SR-similar. It would be interesting to explore more variations of division and multiplication involving x1, and also some use of subtraction and addition. Considering these points, the following equations are proposed:\n\n1. c0*x1 - c1\n2. c0 / (x1 + c1)\n3. c0*x1*c1",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided dataset and existing equations, I notice that the expressions with a lower mean squared error (mse) involve the division operation and the variable x1 in the denominator. This suggests that the relationship between y and x1 may be inversely proportional or have an inverse component. \n\nWith this in mind, I will propose three different expressions that adhere to the given restrictions and use the division operation. I will also aim to maintain low complexity while attempting to reduce the mse. \n\nThe first expression will be a simple inversely proportional relationship with a single constant. \n\nThe second expression will involve a division operation with a more complex denominator to potentially better capture the non-linear relationship. \n\nThe third expression will involve multiplication of x1 with a constant divided by a different constant to add more flexibility in modelling the relationship.",
