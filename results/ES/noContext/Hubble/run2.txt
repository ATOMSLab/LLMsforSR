  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the relationships in the dataset, it appears that there could be a polynomial relationship between x1 and y, given the curve in the plot. This is reflected in the current best equations, which include terms of x1 up to the second order. However, all of these expressions are relatively simple, so there is room to explore more complex relationships.\n\nThe dataset seems to be better represented by a high-degree polynomial regression, indicating a non-linear relationship between x1 and y. However, we want to keep the complexity low, so we should try to avoid going beyond third degree polynomials.\n\nPossible forms of the equation to consider include a linear model with an interaction term, a quadratic model with interaction terms, and a cubic model.\n\nSuggested equations based on these insights:\n1. c[0]*x1+c[1]/x1: This is a combination of a linear term and a reciprocal term. Reciprocal terms can capture certain types of non-linear relationships, and this equation is relatively simple with a complexity of 7.\n2. c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1+c[2]/x1: This equation adds a reciprocal term to the quadratic model. This could potentially capture a wider range of non-linear relationships, although the complexity is somewhat higher at 13.\n3. c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1+c[2]*x1*x1*x1: This is a cubic model. Cubic models can capture more complex non-linear relationships than quadratic models, but they also have a higher complexity. In this case, the complexity is 15.\n\nAll three of these equations are not SR-similar to any of the equations in the current Pareto front.",
