  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the equations, the mean square error decreases as the complexity of the equation increases. The simplest equation has an MSE of 29452.94200293, while the most complex one has an MSE of 26860.86455185.\n\nTo reduce the MSE without significantly increasing the complexity, we can explore the combinations of the terms already present in the equations. We can also try to add new terms with different powers of 'x1' to diversify the search.\n\nThe equations already have terms with x1 raised to the power of 1, 2, and 3. We can try to include terms with 'x1' to the power of 4 and 5 to create new equations. Furthermore, we can also multiply some terms together to create more complex features.\n\nIn creating the new equations, we need to make sure that they are not SR-similar to the existing ones. For instance, equations such as 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1**4' or 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2+c[2]*x1**4' would be SR-similar to the existing ones because they only differ by a constant multiple in one of the terms.\n\nTherefore, the new equations should introduce new terms that are not just multiples of the existing ones.",
