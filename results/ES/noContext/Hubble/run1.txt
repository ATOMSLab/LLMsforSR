Also, the fact that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) decreases as the complexity of the equation increases suggests a non-linear relationship. \n\nGiven the constraints, however, we are limited in the types of operations we can use to generate new equations. We need to ensure that the new equations are not SR-similar to the existing ones and that they are not overly complex.\n\nPotential expressions to consider could include:\n\n1. A quadratic expression without a linear term: c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]\n2. A cubic expression without the quadratic and linear terms: c[0]*x1**3 + c[1]\n3.

  "LLM Thoughts": "In the given dataset, the dependent variable 'y' and the independent variable 'x1' seem to have a polynomial-like relationship. The most accurate but complex equation found so far is a cubic polynomial (c[0]*x1^3+c[1]*x1^2+c[2]*x1+c[3]) with a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 26729.51376774. \n\nHowever, it's also notable that a simple linear equation (c[0]*x1+c[1]) has a relatively low MSE of 31132.62455249 despite its simplicity. This suggests that the data might not need overly complex expressions to achieve a decent fit.\n\nLet's try to find a balance between accuracy and complexity. Given the constraints mentioned above, we need to avoid SR-similar expressions and use only the basic operators. Also, we need to consider that the dataset might show non-linear behaviors, so it might be best to include squared or cubed terms. Based on these observations, I propose the following three equations:\n\n1. A quadratic equation with a linear term: c[0]*x1^2 + c[1]*x1\n2. A quadratic equation divided by a linear term: (c[0]*x1^2 + c[1]) / x1\n3. A cubic equation without the squared term: c[0]*x1^3 + c[1]*x1\n\nIt's worth noting that these equations might not necessarily outperform the ones already found in terms of accuracy, but they offer a different approach and could help to diversify the pool of candidate expressions. These equations also comply with the given restrictions, as they use only the basic operators, don't include complex unary operators, and don't fit constants.",

To provide diverse suggestions, I will avoid these forms and seek alternative structures. \n\nIn the given equations, addition and multiplication are primarily used. To diversify, we can consider using subtraction and division as well. However, we need to be cautious about division as it might introduce undefined values.\n\nAnother point to consider is the range of the independent variable x1, which is between 0 and 2. This suggests that our equation should account for this range.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's propose three new equations:\n\n1. A mixed-term equation with division and subtraction: c[0] / (x1 - c[1])\n2. A quadratic equation with subtraction: c[0] * (x1 - c[1]) ** 2\n3. A linear equation with division: c[0] / x1\n\nThe first equation has a complexity of 7, the same as the simplest equation on the Pareto front, but it introduces division and subtraction. The second equation uses subtraction in a quadratic form, which is different from the ones on the Pareto front, and it has a complexity of 9. The third equation is a simple linear equation using division, with a complexity of 5.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the dataset, it is clear that as x1 increases, y increases. Therefore, it would make sense to incorporate higher powers of x1 into the equations. However, the MSE increases as the complexity increases, so it is probably better to keep the equations as simple as possible.\n\nGiven the current equations, we can see that adding constants and dividing by x1 sometimes decreases the MSE, so these approaches could be useful in generating new equations. Also, it seems like the equations with higher powers of x1 have lower MSE, so incorporating these into the new equations might be beneficial.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to suggest SR-similar expressions to the existing ones. The key is to come up with expressions that are different enough from the existing ones but still make sense given the pattern in the data.\n\nTaking all these into consideration, the new equations could be:\n\n1. 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]' - This equation is a simplification of a higher complexity equation in the Pareto front. It uses a power of 2 for x1 which might help capture the non-linearity in the data while still keeping the complexity low.\n\n2. 'c[0]*x1**3+c[1]/x1' - This equation is a bit more complex. It combines a higher power of x1 with a division by x1. This might help capture the non-linear growth in the data and the division by x1 might help reduce the MSE.\n\n3. 'c[0]*x1**4' - This equation has a higher power of x1.
