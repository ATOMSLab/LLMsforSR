  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided equations, a few patterns can be identified. All equations seem to be using subtraction and division as the main operations. Also, the complexity increases by 2 for each new equation, but the improvement in Mean Squared Error (mse) is quite significant for the first two equations and then becomes marginal.\n\nThe first equation 'c[0]-x1' is the simplest one, but also has the highest mse. It's basically a linear model with a negative slope.\n\nThe second equation 'c[0]-c[1]/x1' adds a bit of complexity by introducing a division and a second constant. This significantly improves the mse.\n\nThe third equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]-x1)' introduces multiplication and flips the division in the denominator, which only slightly improves the mse.\n\nThe fourth equation 'c[0]*(c[1]+x1)/(c[2]+x1)' introduces a third constant and adds more complexity by adding a sum in both numerator and denominator. However, the improvement in mse is again only marginal.\n\nBased on these findings, the following equations might be worth trying:\n\n1. 'c[0]/(x1+c[1])': It's similar to the second equation but flips the division and changes the subtraction to addition in the denominator. This might be a good candidate because it introduces a non-linearity while still keeping the complexity relatively low.\n\n2. 'c[0]*c[1]/(x1+c[2])': This equation introduces a multiplication of two constants in the numerator. It's a variation of the third equation but changes the subtraction to addition in the denominator and multiplies the constants instead of the variable and the constant.\n\n3. 'c[0]*(x1+c[1])/(c[2]*x1)': This equation is a variation of the fourth equation but changes the addition of a constant and a variable to a multiplication in the denominator. This could potentially introduce a new pattern, especially if the variable x1 has a higher impact than the constants.",
