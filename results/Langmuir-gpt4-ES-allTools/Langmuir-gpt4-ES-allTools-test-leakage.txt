      ...Scratch Pad:

Given that the dataset is about nitrogen adsorbing onto mica, with pressure as the independent variable and loading as the dependent variable, we should consider the physical process involved. 

The process of adsorption often follows a Langmuir isotherm model, which can be expressed as y = c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1). This equation has been identified in the Pareto front with a complexity of 7 and mse of 0.12263081, which is the lowest mse among the given equations.

To find diverse expressions, I would need to consider other possible physical phenomena that might be at play. Given these restrictions on the equation form, it is challenging to incorporate other physical models. However, I can propose variations that might capture non-linear relationships in the data.

I can propose these three new equations:

1. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1**2)': This equation is a modification of the Langmuir isotherm model, introducing a non-linear dependence on x1 in the denominator. 
2. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1 + c[2])': This equation is another modification of the Langmuir isotherm model, introducing an additional constant that could capture a linear offset.
3. 'c[0]*x1 - c[1]/(x1**2)': This equation introduces a new form that contrasts with the Langmuir isotherm m...
