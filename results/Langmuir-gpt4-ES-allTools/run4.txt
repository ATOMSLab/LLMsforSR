The goal is to suggest new equations that minimize both complexity and loss, and are diverse.\n\nLooking at the current equations, we can see that the most complex equation has a complexity of 13 and mse of 304.89256067, and the least complex equation has a complexity of 3 and mse of 87.90236102.\n\nThe equation with the lowest mse (0.12213021) has a complexity of 7.\n\nThe equations use a mix of operators (+, -, *, /) and constants (c[0], c[1], c[2]).\n\nFrom this, we can infer that simpler equations tend to have higher mse, and complex equations tend to have lower mse, but there are exceptions.\n\nWe need to come up with new equations that are diverse and minimize both complexity and mse. We should focus on using different combinations of operators and constants, and avoid using complex unary operators or fitting constants.",
