  "LLM Thoughts": "Based on the analysis, it is observed that the complexity of the equation and the mean squared error (mse) are inversely related. As the complexity increases, the mse decreases, indicating a better fit to the data. However, higher complexity may lead to overfitting and less interpretability.

The equations will be kept simple to satisfy the complexity requirement.\n\nConsidering the restrictions, I'll suggest three new diverse equations:\n\n1.
