  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nBased on the provided dataset and the Pareto front analysis, it's clear that we're dealing with a non-linear regression problem. The mean squared error (MSE) tends to decrease as the complexity of the equation increases, which is expected as more complex models can fit the data better. However, we want to suggest equations that balance both accuracy and complexity for better generalization and interpretability.\n\nThe independent variable 'x1' shows a non-linear relationship with the dependent variable 'y'. The given equations mostly use polynomials of 'x1', with the power of 'x1' increasing with complexity. Therefore, we can use similar structures but in a different combination to form new expressions.\n\nRemembering the restrictions and avoiding SR-similar expressions, we can form the following equations: \n1. c0*x1 + c1*x1**3: This is a combination of linear and cubic terms of 'x1', which might capture the non-linearity in a different way.\n2. c0/x1 + c1*x1: This equation introduces a division operation, which might help capture the relationship better.\n3. c0 + c1*x1**2: This equation is a simpler version of the quadratic terms used in the Pareto front, but might still provide a good fit with less complexity.",

I will suggest equations with similar complexity to the existing ones, but with different forms, to provide diverse options.\n\nHere are the three equations I suggest:\n\n1. A linear combination of x1 and the square of x1: c0*x1 + c1*x1**2\n   This equation is relatively simple with a complexity of 9, but it may capture the potential non-linear relationship between x1 and y.\n\n2. A combination of a linear and inverse term: c0*x1 + c1/(x1+1)\n   This equation has a slightly higher complexity of 11. The inverse term may help capture any potential inverse relationship between x1 and y.\n\n3. A combination of a cubic and inverse term: c0*x1**3 + c1/(x1+1)\n   This equation has a complexity of 13. It may capture complex non-linear and inverse relationships.\n\nThese equations are diverse and none of them are SR-similar to the provided ones.",
