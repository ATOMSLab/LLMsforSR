Looking at the relationship between semi-major axis and period in planetary motion, we can observe that it follows Kepler's third law of planetary motion. The law states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. 

So, we will try to find expressions that follow this law or its variations. 

Given the constraints, we can consider the following expressions: 

1. The direct relationship: y^2 = c0 * x1^3
2. The square root of the relationship: y = sqrt(c0 * x1^3)
3. An inverse relationship: 1/y^2 = c0 / x1^3

We can also consider expressions that include linear combinations of the relationships, like:

4. y = c0 * x1^3 + c1 * x1
5. y = sqrt(c0 * x1^3) + c1 * x1

Remembering that the expressions need to be short and well-fitted, the first three expressions are the most likely to be a good fit. 

Therefore, the three equations that I propose are y^2 = c0 * x1^3, y = sqrt(c0 * x1^3), and 1/y^2 = c0 / x1^3....

Given the provided dataset is about planetary motion in astrophysics, Kepler's third law of planetary motion could be taken into consideration. The law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. 

In the provided Pareto front, we already have a cube function and a square root of cube function. We can add some variations to these basic forms while keeping the complexity low and obeying the restrictions. 

The first equation in the Pareto front shows a decreasing function (c0/x1^3) and the remaining two equations show increasing functions. We can consider adding an equation that is a sum of an increasing and decreasing function. 

We can also consider an equation that is a difference between an increasing function and a decreasing function. 

Remembering the restrictions, we must not use any trigonometric, exponential or logarithmic functions. The complexity should also be kept as low as possible....

In this dataset, we are trying to predict the period of planetary motion (y) using the semi-major axis (x1). The expressions that have been provided so far seem to be following either a cubic or inverse square relationship with x1, which aligns with Kepler's third law of planetary motion.

Let's try to create three new simplified expressions that are not 'SR-similar' to the ones given, while also satisfying the restrictions provided.

1. For the first expression, we can simplify and modify the second equation from the Pareto front: 'c[0]*x1-c[1]/x1**2'. If we remove the second term, we get 'c[0]*x1', which is a simple linear relationship.

2. The second equation will be a simple inverse relationship with x1, 'c[0]/x1'. This equation is less complex than the given equations and is not SR-similar to them.

3. For the third equation, we can try to combine the concepts of the first and the second equation in the Pareto front. We can use the square root operation from the third equation and the cubic power from the first equation to form the expression '(c[0]*x1)**0.5'. This is a less complex equation and is not SR-similar to the given ones....

Looking at the Pareto front, it is clear that the dataset shows a non-linear relationship between the semi-major axis (x1) and the period in days (y). The best-fitted equations show a trend of increasing complexity, starting with linear terms, then moving to quadratic, inverse quadratic, and then a radical function involving a cubic term, all while the mean square error (MSE) is decreasing.

Given the constraints and the need to avoid SR-similar expressions, we need to propose new equations that are diverse and yet within the complexity range. 

Considering the theme of the dataset (planetary motion in astrophysics), Kepler's third law of planetary motion could be a potential guiding principle. It postulates a relationship between the period of the planet's orbit (T) and the semi-major axis of its orbit (a) as T^2 = k * a^3, where k is a constant. However, we are not allowed to use exponentials, so we'll have to adapt it to the restrictions. 

Taking this into account, I can propose three new equations that follow the form of Kepler's third law, while also ensuring diversity, minimizing complexity, and abiding by the given restrictions....

Looking at the given Pareto front, we can see that the 'mse' substantially drops with an increase in complexity. However, we're tasked with minimizing both complexity and loss. The best performing equation is "(c[0]*x1**3)**0.5" with an 'mse' of 46.68860689 and complexity of 7. We need to generate new equations which are less complex and aim to have a low mse score.

Since we're dealing with planetary motion and Kepler's third law states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, we should ensure our equations reflect this relationship. Also, we're limited to only using the variable 'x1', operators (+, -, *, /, sqrt()), and constants (c0, c1, etc.).

Given these constraints, we need to come up with equations that aren't SR-similar to the ones we already have. This means we need to avoid equations that are equivalent to the existing ones once the constants are fitted....

Looking at the provided Pareto front, I notice that the use of sqrt() function, power functions like x1**2, and x1**3 are common. This suggests that these components may be key in fitting the data accurately.

My goal is to suggest three new equations that are diverse and minimize both complexity and loss. Since the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics where y is period in days and x1 is semi-major axis, it's well-known from Kepler's third law that the square of the period (y) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (x1) of its orbit. This relationship might help in suggesting new equations.

My first suggestion would be to consider an equation of the form 'c[0]*x1**3'. This equation is derived from Kepler's third law, and its complexity is less than the sqrt(c[0]*x1**3) equation in the Pareto front. 

For the second equation, I would suggest 'c[0]*sqrt(x1**3)'. This equation is a variation of the 'sqrt(c[0]*x1**3)' equation in the Pareto front, but it includes the sqrt() function differently. 

For the third equation, I would propose 'c[0]*x1/c[1]*sqrt(x1)'. This equation is a combination of the linear term 'c[0]*x1' and the square root term 'sqrt(x1)', and it introduces a new division operation which could make it diverse from the existing equations in the Pareto front....

Looking at the nature of the data, which discusses the relationship between the period of a planet and its semi-major axis, Kepler's third law of planetary motion comes to mind. According to Kepler's third law, the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

Therefore, the simplest expression that comes to mind is y = c0 * (x1)^1.5. Here, c0 is a constant that can be adjusted for the best fit.

Additionally, we can consider a simple linear relationship, y = c0 + c1*x1. This would be a less accurate representation of the data but could serve as a baseline to compare the quality of more complex expressions.

Lastly, a potential quadratic relationship could also be considered, y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*(x1)^2. This would allow for a slight curve in the trend line, potentially improving fit....

For the provided dataset, the goal is to find new equations that minimize both complexity and mean squared error (mse), while avoiding redundancy. The given equations and their associated complexities and mse are:

Given that the independent variable is semi-major axis and the dependent variable is period in days, and considering the Kepler's 3rd law, we can experiment with powers of x1. Moreover, only operators +, -, *, / and sqrt() are allowed.

Let's analyze the provided dataset:
- The first equation has medium complexity and highest mean squared error (MSE).
- The second equation has low complexity but high MSE.
- The third and fourth equations have the same MSE, but the fourth one has lower complexity.
- The fifth equation has higher complexity but lower MSE.
- The last equation has the highest complexity but the lowest MSE.

From the above analysis, we can see that as the complexity increases, the MSE decreases, which is expected because more complex models tend to fit the data better.

From the problem domain, we know that Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This leads to an equation of the form T = c * r^3/2 where T is the period and r is the semi-major axis.

Considering the restrictions and trying to come up with diverse equations, we can try the following forms:
1. A variation of the Kepler's law formula but without the cube term: c[0]*sqrt(x1)
2. A linear combination of x1 and sqrt(x1): c[0]*x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1)

Looking at the current Pareto front, it seems like a combination of addition/subtraction and multiplication/division with the variable x1 tends to produce less mean square error. Also, the use of square root operator seems to increase complexity without significantly reducing the loss. Hence, it might be best to avoid using sqrt() in the proposed expressions, unless necessary. 

Given that the dataset is about planetary motion in astrophysics, it is also essential to consider the physics of the situation. Kepler's third law states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

In astrophysics, Kepler's laws describe the motion of planets around the sun. The 3rd law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Therefore, the expressions will likely involve a cube and square root operation.

Since only five operators (+, -, *, /, sqrt) are allowed, we can also try simple expressions including these operators. However, considering the nature of the problem, it's unlikely that simple addition, subtraction, or division will provide a good fit.

2) 'c[0]*x1/c[1]+sqrt(x1**3)': This equation introduces division operator '/' to add complexity, while maintaining the 'sqrt(x1**3)' structure.

3) 'sqrt(c[0]*x1**3+c[1]*x1**2)': This equation is similar to the first suggestion but added a quadratic term 'c[1]*x1**2' inside the square root to add more flexibility.
   
Remember, we are trying to find the simplest equation that also has a low mse. Therefore, these equations aim to maintain a balance between complexity and accuracy....

Looking at the Pareto front, it seems that taking the square root of a polynomial of x1 is a common theme in the better-performing (lower MSE) equations. The data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, which is governed by Kepler's laws. The third law states that the square of the orbital period (y) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (x1). This might explain why the cube of x1 appears in many equations.

The complexity of the equations increases as more terms and constants are added. The MSE decreases as the equations become more complex, but this might lead to overfitting. We need to find a balance between low complexity and low MSE.

There are some constraints that we need to consider. We are limited to five operators (+, -, *, /, sqrt()) and we can't fit constants, but use c0, c1, etc. We also have to avoid SR-similar expressions.

We should come up with diverse equations that are not SR-similar to the ones we already have. This means we should avoid equations that are equivalent to the current ones after fitting the constants. For example, if we have c0*x1**3, we should not suggest c1*x1**3, because it's essentially the same equation with a different constant.

We can experiment with differ...

Observing the dataset, it's clear that the relationship between period and semi-major axis follows Kepler's third law, which in its simplest form is y = k*x^(3/2), where y is the period, x is the semi-major axis, and k is a constant.

We can start with some simple equations that follow this law and add complexity gradually, while avoiding SR-similar expressions. The suggested equations should strike a balance between complexity and mean squared error (mse).

Equation 1:
A simple equation based on Kepler's law would be y = sqrt(c0*x1^3). This equation has a moderate complexity of 7 and a relatively low mse of 46.68. However, this equation has already been suggested in the given Pareto front. We need to suggest diverse equations.

Equation 2:
We could add another term to the numerator of the equation to account for any possible linear relationship between the period and the semi-major axis: y = sqrt(c0*x1^3 + c1*x1).

Equation 3:
Another equation to consider could include a second term in the denominator that accounts for any possible quadratic relationship between the period and the semi-m...

Looking at the data, the mean squared error (MSE) decreases as the complexity of the equation increases. However, after a certain point, increasing complexity does not significantly improve the MSE.

The dataset is about planetary motion in astrophysics. The Kepler's third law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This could be a good starting point for suggesting new equations.

Avoiding SR-similar expressions requires careful selection of operators, constants, and variables. Some of the expressions already provided are similar or same with just different written forms (like sqrt(c[0]*x1**3) and c[0]*sqrt(x1**3)).

Let's create three diverse equations with different levels of complexity that might fit the data and satisfy all the restrictions....

The data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, and the laws governing these often follow Kepler's 3rd law, which states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This suggests that equations involving powers of 3/2 and 2/3 might be useful.

Looking at the previous equations, it seems that sqrt() function and power 3 are prevalent and have lower error. However, there are no equations with the power of 2/3, which could be a good candidate considering Kepler's third law. 

Also, while most equations have used the sqrt() operator, none have used it over a division operation. This might be an interesting avenue to explore.

Given the restrictions, we can also experiment with a polynomial of x1 with degree 2, as none of the previously suggested equations uses this form.

Finally, we should also consider using the "-" operator, since it's not used in the best performing equations....

Looking at the provided equations, the expressions with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) involve a combination of the square root function, multiplication, and addition/subtraction. The dataset is related to planetary motion, specifically the relationship between the semi-major axis and the period. Kepler's Third Law suggests a relationship between the square of the period and the cube of the semi-major axis, which is generally applicable to all bodies orbiting the Sun.

Given the constraints, I will suggest three equations that draw inspiration from Kepler's Third Law, but vary in complexity by introducing combinations of the allowed operators. These equations are not SR-similar to the provided ones, as they introduce unique combinations of operators....

The dataset appears to resemble Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which describes the relationship between the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit (x1) and its period (y). The law states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This can be represented as y^2 = c0 * x1^3.

However, since we are only allowed to use the operators +, -, *, / and sqrt(), we can't directly use the square or cube functions. But we can mimic these functions using the allowed operators. For example, x1*x1*x1 can be used to represent x1^3 and sqrt(y)*sqrt(y) can be used to represent y^2.

We can try to form three equations that fit these restrictions and approximately describe the data:

1. y = c0 * sqrt(x1*x1*x1)
2. sqrt(y) = c0 * x1 * sqrt(x1)
3. y = c0 * x1 * sqrt(x1)...

- Analyzing the provided Pareto front, the equations are similar, with the only difference being the way the sqrt() function is used. 
- The mean squared error (mse) for both equations is the same, indicating that they have similar predictive accuracy. 
- The complexity of the equations is also similar, with the first equation being slightly more complex due to the power of 3 in the sqrt() function. 
- To propose new equations, I should aim for diversity in the mathematical operations used while maintaining a low complexity and mse. 
- As the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, the period of a planet (y) is determined by the semi-major axis of its orbit (x1).
- According to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This gives me a clue to propose new equations.
- The restrictions indicate that I can use the five basic mathematical operators and should use the variable x1 and constants represented by c[0], c[1], etc. 
- SR-similarity should be avoided to prevent redundant expressions....

Analyzing the provided Pareto front, there has been a variety of equations tested with varying complexity and mean square error (mse). The simplest equation used is 'c[0]/x1' with a complexity of 3 but with the highest mse of 22349160.72073979. The equation with the lowest mse is 'c[0]*sqrt(x1*x1*x1)' and 'c[0]*x1*sqrt(x1)' but with a higher complexity of 8 and 6 respectively.

In astrophysics, the period of a planet's orbit (P) is related to the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. In other words, P^2 = k*a^3, where k is a constant.

However, there are limitations in terms of the operators we can use. We can't use exponentials, but we can use multiplication and the sqrt() function to create equivalent expressions.

We are to create three new, diverse equations that minimize both complexity and mse. We need to ensure that we don't create SR-similar expressions. For instance, if we have an equation c0/(x1*c1), we can't suggest c0/x1 as they are SR-similar.

Based on the available operators and restrictions, the following equations could be suggested:
1. c0*sqrt(x1*x1*x1) - This is a variant of the most accurate equation we have so far, but with the sqrt() function applied to the entire expression rather than just x1.
2. c0*(sqrt(x1)) * x1 - This is a mix of multiplication and the sqrt() function, which might yield a more accurate result with less...

      ...Looking at the data and remembering Kepler's laws, we can see that the cube of the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit is directly proportional to the square of the orbital period. As such, we should expect to see a power relation between the semi-major axis (x1) and the period (y). We can also see that the square root function has been used in several of the best performing expressions so far.

Considering the restrictions, here are three expressions that are diverse from each other and from the ones already tried, and may potentially fit the data well:

1. The first is a squared relation, but with a square root applied to the whole expression: sqrt(c[0]*x1*x1). This is different from both a pure square and pure cube relation.

2. The second is a division of the square root of x1 by a constant: c[0]/sqrt(x1). This is a variation on the division theme, but with the addition of the square root.

3. The third is a multiplication of x1 by the square root of x1: c[0]*x1*sqrt(x1). This is a novel combination of multiplication and t...
