The law states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This can be represented as y^2 = c0 * x1^3.\n\nHowever, since we are only allowed to use the operators +, -, *, / and sqrt(), we can't directly use the square or cube functions. But we can mimic these functions using the allowed operators. For example, x1*x1*x1 can be used to represent x1^3 and sqrt(y)*sqrt(y) can be used to represent y^2.\n\nWe can try to form three equations that fit these restrictions and approximately describe the data:\n\n1. y = c0 * sqrt(x1*x1*x1)\n2. sqrt(y) = c0 * x1 * sqrt(x1)\n3. y = c0 * x1 * sqrt(x1)",

In other words, P^2 = k*a^3, where k is a constant.\n\nHowever, there are limitations in terms of the operators we can use. We can't use exponentials, but we can use multiplication and the sqrt() function to create equivalent expressions.\n\nWe are to create three new, diverse equations that minimize both complexity and mse. We need to ensure that we don't create SR-similar expressions. For instance, if we have an equation c0/(x1*c1), we can't suggest c0/x1 as they are SR-similar.\n\nBased on the available operators and restrictions, the following equations could be suggested:\n1. c0*sqrt(x1*x1*x1) - This is a variant of the most accurate equation we have so far, but with the sqrt() function applied to the entire expression rather than just x1.\n2. c0*(sqrt(x1)) * x1 - This is a mix of multiplication and the sqrt() function, which might yield a more accurate result with less complexity.\n3. c0*x1/x1 - This is a simple equation and hence less complex, but it might not provide a very accurate result.

The first is a squared relation, but with a square root applied to the whole expression: sqrt(c[0]*x1*x1). This is different from both a pure square and pure cube relation.\n\n2. The second is a division of the square root of x1 by a constant: c[0]/sqrt(x1). This is a variation on the division theme, but with the addition of the square root.\n\n3.
