As per the restrictions, we can only use these operators. We should also keep in mind that we need to avoid SR-similar expressions. \n\nLet's start by thinking of some combinations of the operators. We can try using the square root operation with other operations in a different way than the provided equations. We can also experiment with the order of operations, and try using the division operation in combination with others. \n\nThe first equation that comes to mind is c[0]*sqrt(x1*c[1])+c[2]. This expression is a bit different from the current ones as it involves the multiplication of x1 and a constant inside the square root. This might be able to capture some non-linearity in the dataset.\n\nThe second equation we can try is c[0] + c[1]/(x1+c[2]).
