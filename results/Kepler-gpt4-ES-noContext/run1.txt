This captures the rapid growth of y with increasing x1, although it might not be a perfect fit for the data.\n\nAnother possible approximation is a cubic relationship, where y = c0*x1^3. This would capture an even faster growth of y with increasing x1.\n\nFinally, we can consider a square root relationship, where y = c0*sqrt(x1). This would capture a slower growth of y with increasing x1.\n\nWe need to keep in mind that an exact fit is not possible with the operators provided, so we're looking for the best approximations.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the analysis, it can be noticed that there is a wide range of mean-square error (mse) values and complexities, but the mse decreases as the complexity increases. It's also evident that the equations involving sqrt(x1) and x1**(2) have lower mse.\n\nFor generating the new equations, the strategy would be to borrow elements from the existing equations but combine them in a different manner to create unique expressions. By doing so, the new equations will hopefully strike a good balance between complexity and mse. I will also try to incorporate both addition and multiplication in the equations to introduce variety. \n\nAs per the restrictions, only five operators are allowed: +, -, *, / and sqrt(), and no other complex unary functions or exponential functions are allowed. The equations should contain only the accessible independent variables from the data, which in this case is x1. \n\nWhile generating the new equations, care will be taken to avoid SR-similar expressions. An expression is considered SR-similar to another if it becomes equivalent to the other after fitting constants to data. For example, the expressions - c0/(x1-c1) & c0/(x1+c1) are SR-similar because the sign of a constant can be absorbed after fitting. Similarly, x1*(c0+c1) & x1*c0 are SR-similar because c0 and c1 can be consolidated into one fitted constant, and c0/(x1*c1) & c0/x1 are SR-similar because c0 and c1 can be consolidated into one fitted constant.",
