      ...Scratch Pad:
The dataset seems to represent the period of planets in our solar system as a function of their distance from the sun. The dependent variable, y, is the period in Earth days, and the independent variable, x1, is the distance from the sun in Astronomical Units (AU). 

Given the existing equations in the Pareto front, I can see that the sqrt(x1) function is used, which indicates a half power relation. However, Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion actually states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit, which would suggest a power 3/2 relation.

We should also note that the dataset seems to grow more quickly than linearly, which suggests the use of multiplication instead of addition or subtraction. 

Since the complexity of the equation is also a consideration, we should aim for expressions that use fewer operations while still capturing the essence of the data. Equations that involve division or multiplication may be more complex than those that only involve addition or subtraction, but they may also provide a better fit to the data. 

Since we are not allowed to use any complex unary operators (trigonometric functions or exponentials), we are limited to using the basic operators (+, -, *, /, sqrt) in our expressions.

Based on these considerations, one possible equation could be c0*x1^3/2, which reflects the 3/2 power relationshi...
