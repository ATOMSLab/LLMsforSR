Possible transformations:\n   - Since we need the function to be monotonic non-decreasing, consider using transformations that are inherently increasing, such as logarithmic or exponential functions.\n   - The square root and logarithm functions are generally increasing for positive x1, which could be useful.\n   - Since the relationship seems to be decreasing in the dataset but should be increasing, we might consider using 1/x1 or transformations that adjust this behavior.\n\n4. Restrictions:\n   - Only use simple arithmetic and a limited set of functions.\n   - Use constants (c0, c1, etc.) to fit the curve, but avoid fitting constants directly to the data points.\n\n5.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Looking at the dataset, the dependent variable y decreases as x1 increases. The relationship seems to be non-linear, with a trend suggesting a potential logarithmic or power relationship.\n\n2. From the previous equations, `c[0]*log(x1+c[1])` has the lowest MSE, implying a logarithmic fit may be appropriate. It meets all constraints with the right constants.\n\n3. Another potential form is a power law, `c[0]*sqrt(x1)`, which had a reasonably low MSE and satisfies monotonicity and non-negativity with the correct coefficient. However, this form doesn't perfectly match all constraints as the derivative can be finite at x1=0 without proper constants.\n\n4. Considering the constraints and the previous results, we should look for expressions that:\n   - Have a logarithmic component to maintain a good fit.\n   - Use powers or roots to fit the non-linear trend.\n   - Ensure monotonicity and non-negativity.\n\n5. Potential new forms:\n   - Logarithmic with a shift: `c[0]*log(x1+c[1])` worked well, so similar forms like `c[0]*log(c[1]*x1+1)` should be tested.\n   - Rational forms such as `c[0]/(x1+c[1])` can be explored with different placements or powers of x1.\n   - Combine power laws and logarithms: `c[0] * x1**c[1] + c[2] * log(x1+c[3])`.\n\n6.

The current equations present a good starting point, and I will try to avoid redundancy by creating diverse expressions that adhere to the constraints.\n\n1. Non-negativity: The equations must ensure that y(x1) \u2265 0 for all x1 \u2265 0. This typically implies using expressions that don't inherently become negative for positive x1, such as squares or absolute values.\n\n2. Finite, positive initial slope: As x1 \u2192 0\u207a, y(x1) should approach 0, and the derivative should be finite and positive. This can be managed by using expressions like c0*x1 or c0*sqrt(x1), which naturally have this behavior.\n\n3. Monotonic non-decrease: The derivative dy/dx1 should be \u2265 0 for all x1 > 0. This can be achieved using non-decreasing functions like logarithms or exponentials combined with positive coefficients.\n\nGiven restrictions: \n- Only acceptable binary operators are +, -, *, /. \n- Unary operators are limited to square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp.\n- We must avoid equations that are SR-similar to the ones already given.\n\nConsidering these points, let's construct new equations. \n\n1.

Current Pareto Front Analysis:\n   - The equations exhibit a range of complexities and mean squared errors (mse).\n   - The equation with the lowest mse (0.11522391) has a complexity of 12. This indicates a more accurate fit but higher complexity.\n   - Simpler equations have higher mse, indicating a trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n3. Observations:\n   - Logarithmic and square root terms seem effective, given the constraints and nature of the data (adsorption isotherm).\n   - The initial slope constraint is well-handled by terms like c0 * sqrt(x1) and c0 * log(x1 + c1).\n   - Monotonicity is inherently supported by these forms.\n\n4. Expression Suggestions:\n   - We need to maintain diversity, minimize complexity, and ensure the constraints are met.\n   - The current dataset suggests that pressure (x1) affects loading (y) in a non-linear, saturating manner.
