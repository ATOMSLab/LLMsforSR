  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLet's first try to understand the behavior of the given dataset. Observing the provided data, as the pressure (x1) increases, the loading (y) decreases. This indicates a type of inverse relationship or decay.\n\n1. Non-negativity: The function should yield non-negative values for all x1 >= 0. This rules out expressions that could become negative for positive x1.\n\n2. Finite, positive initial slope: For small x1, y should approach zero but start with a positive slope. This suggests a function that starts small and grows as x1 increases.\n\n3. Monotonic non-decrease: The function should not decrease as x1 increases. This is tricky because the observed data shows a decreasing trend, but the constraint requires a non-decreasing function. This implies the function should asymptotically approach a value without decreasing.\n\nLet's try and construct some expressions:\n\n- A function like y = c0 / (x1 + c1) could fit well because it starts with a high value when x1 is small, and decreases as x1 increases, asymptotically approaching zero.\n\n- A square root function, y = c0 * sqrt(x1 + c1), could work because it is non-negative and has a positive slope for small values of x1.\n\n- An exponential function like y = c0 * exp(-c1 * x1) might also work, as it starts with a high value and decreases as x1 increases. However, it needs to be adjusted to ensure non-decreasing behavior according to the constraints.\n\nConsidering these constraints and behaviors, let's propose some expressions, keeping them minimal:",

We must not use redundant expressions.\n4.

We should explore other non-linear expressions that satisfy constraints and restrictions:\n   - Consider square root, which maintains non-negativity and can provide a finite slope at zero.\n   - Explore combinations of log and linear terms for monotonicity.\n   - Consider simple polynomial forms with positive coefficients for simplicity and monotonicity.",

This equation, however, is quite complex (complexity 10) and we should aim for simpler alternatives with a similar pattern.\n\n3.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1.
