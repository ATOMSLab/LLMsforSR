  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Constraint Analysis**: \n   - The dataset shows a decreasing trend. However, the constraints require the function to be non-negative and monotonic non-decreasing. This suggests that the dataset might be part of a larger curve that eventually plateaus or increases.\n   - As x1 approaches 0, y should approach 0, which implies that y might have a form like x1 or sqrt(x1).\n\n2. **Data Pattern**: \n   - The data appears to have a curve that decreases with increasing x1. The relation might be inversely proportional or logarithmic.\n   - The previous equations with log(x1) showed good performance. It's beneficial to explore logarithmic or inverse terms.\n\n3. **Expression Suggestions**:\n   - To achieve non-negativity and monotonic non-decreasing behavior, we can consider expressions with sqrt(x1) and log(x1).\n   - Previous good fits used log, so including log(x1) in a new form might yield a good fit.\n   - The use of inverse terms (1/x1) seems promising for capturing the decreasing trend initially at higher x1 values.\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**:\n   - Aim for expressions with complexity no greater than 9 to avoid overly complex models, while achieving low MSE.\n\n5. **Diverse Suggestions**:\n   - Combine different operations like sqrt, log, and inverse to capture variations in data.\n\nConsidering these points, here are three new candidate expressions:\n\n1. y = c0 * log(x1) / x1\n2. y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1 / x1\n3. y = c0 * log(x1) + c1 * sqrt(x1) / x1",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Constraints and Restrictions Review:**\n   - We need non-negative expressions for all x1 \u2265 0.\n   - The initial slope should be finite and positive.\n   - The function should be monotonic non-decreasing for x1 > 0.\n   - We can only use +, -, *, /, and specific unary operators (square, cube, sqrt, log, exp).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Existing Equations:**\n   - The equation with the best MSE is `c[0]*sqrt(x1)+c[1]*log(x1)+c[2]` (complexity: 11, MSE: 0.118939). It's complex but accurate.\n   - `c[0]*exp(-c[1]/x1)+c[2]` is also accurate with slightly higher complexity (complexity: 10, MSE: 0.15763996).\n   - `c[0]*log(x1)+c[1]` is simpler yet still accurate (complexity: 6, MSE: 0.29885775).\n\n3. **Generating New Suggestions:**\n   - Avoid using combinations too similar to existing ones (e.g., combinations of sqrt and log).\n   - Use the constraints to guide expression creation, ensuring non-negativity and monotonicity.\n\n4. **Potential New Expressions:**\n   - We can explore combinations using 'cube' and 'square' as they haven't been extensively used in the existing set.\n   - Consider expressions like `c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1])` which inherently satisfies the monotonicity constraint.\n   - Try expressions like `c[0]*cube(log(x1)) + c[1]` which can offer diversity.\n\n5. **Final Candidate Suggestions:**\n   - `c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1])`: Simple, satisfies monotonicity, and allows for non-negativity.\n   - `c[0]*cube(log(x1)) + c[1]`: Uses cube, provides a potentially diverse form.\n   - `c[0]*x1/(sqrt(x1)+c[1])`: Combines sqrt and linear terms, ensuring non-decrease.",

We can explore variations of these models or similar forms that adhere to constraints.\n\nLet's propose the following:\n\n1.

Constraints and restrictions:\n   - Ensure that any new expressions adhere to non-negativity, finite initial slope, and monotonic non-decreasing constraints.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions.\n   - Use allowed unary and binary operators only.\n\n3. Dataset insights:\n   - y decreases as x1 increases, indicating a decaying relationship.\n   - The nature of adsorption suggests a saturating curve, possibly logarithmic or asymptotic in nature.\n\n4. Diverse expression suggestions:\n   - Consider different mathematical forms: asymptotic, logarithmic, and polynomial.\n   \n5. Formulating new expressions:\n   - Consider using a simple asymptotic form, potentially 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' which is already good but aim for diversity.\n   - Use logarithmic combinations like 'c[0]*log(x1+c[1])+c[2]*sqrt(x1)'.\n   - Explore simple exponential growth forms that respect constraints.",
