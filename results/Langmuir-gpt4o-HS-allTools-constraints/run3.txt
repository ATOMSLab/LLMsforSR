This suggests a negative correlation between y and x1. However, we need to ensure our expressions satisfy the given constraints and restrictions.\n\n1. Non-negativity: As x1 decreases, we approach a situation where y should remain non-negative. This typically suggests a form like y = c0 * f(x1) where f(x1) is non-negative.\n2. Finite, positive initial slope: At very low pressures (as x1 approaches 0 from the positive side), the slope should be positive and finite, suggesting a soft curve near the origin.\n3. Monotonic non-decrease: y should be non-decreasing with respect to x1, which suggests a form like y = g(x1) where g(x1) is a non-decreasing function.\n\nConsidering the form of the dataset and the constraints, let's explore potential expressions:\n\n1. A logarithmic model: y = c0 * log(x1) can be considered because log(x1) is a non-decreasing function for x1 > 0.\n2. A square root model: y = c1 * sqrt(x1) is non-decreasing and satisfies the constraints.\n3. An exponential decay model: y = c2 * exp(-x1) is non-decreasing as x1 increases, but we need to ensure the constraints are met.",

To suggest diverse expressions, we can consider other forms that include the allowed unary operators while maintaining low complexity.\n\n3. Potential candidates could include:\n   - A square root function, as `sqrt(x1)` tends to be simple and can fit well with logarithmic patterns.\n   - A rational function such as `c[0] / (x1 + c[1])`, which can model saturation effects often observed in adsorption processes.\n   - An exponential form like `c[0]*(1 - exp(-x1/c[1]))`, which can model growth towards a saturation point.\n\n4.

The restrictions on the operators must be observed as well.\n\n1. Looking at the dataset, y decreases as x1 increases, indicating perhaps a saturation behavior. This suggests forms similar to y = c0 * (1 - exp(-x1/c1)), which captures saturation behavior and has worked well given the best MSE in previous suggestions. However, I need to come up with a diverse set of expressions.\n\n2. Considering the constraint of monotonic non-decrease, the derivative with respect to x1 should be non-negative. Simple functions like sqrt(x1) or log(x1) may be useful as they have non-negative derivatives and fit the constraints.\n\n3. To ensure non-negativity, expressions like c0 * log(x1 + 1) are useful since log(x1 + 1) is non-negative for x1 \u2265 0.\n\n4. For simplicity and to avoid SR-similarity, expressions that are not directly transformations of previous suggestions should be considered. Thus, I will aim for:\n\n   a. A saturation-type model but with a variation in structure.\n   b. A logarithmic model that captures the slow decreasing trend.\n   c.

Lower complexity is generally desirable unless the mse gain is substantial.\n\n3. We want diverse expressions, so avoiding SR-similar expressions to those already provided is crucial.\n\nReviewing the provided equations:\n- Many use logarithmic and exponential functions, which are suitable for adsorption models due to their asymptotic and saturation behavior.\n- The equation with the lowest mse is `c[0]*(x1/(c[1]+x1))`, which is a Langmuir-like isotherm. Variations of this can be explored.\n- Another low mse expression is `c[0]*(1-exp(-x1/(c[1]+x1)))`, which has a bit more complexity but captures saturation behavior well.\n\nConsiderations for new expressions:\n- Explore combinations of x1 with log or exp to satisfy the monotonic and asymptotic constraints.\n- Try to lower complexity while maintaining a reasonable mse by using simple forms that already imply saturation, such as hyperbolic forms or simple polynomials combined with log/exp.\n- Consider using a polynomial form like `x1/(c1 + x1^2)` that can capture saturation without reaching negative values.\n\nPossible new expressions:\n1. A simple polynomial form similar to the Langmuir isotherm but with a cube term: `c0 * (x1^2/(c1 + x1^3))`\n2. A form using square root for gentle saturation: `c0 * sqrt(x1/(c1 + x1))`\n3. An exponential decay form with a polynomial inside the exponential: `c0 * (1 - exp(-sqrt(x1/c1)))`",

Constraints and restrictions:\n   - Non-negativity and monotonicity suggest forms like log(1 + x1) or exp(-x1) are good candidates.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions, meaning attempts should be distinct in form, not just parameters.\n   - Constraints imply functions should be bounded and smooth for positive x1.\n\n4. Strategy for new equations:\n   - Test combinations of log, exp, and rational functions to find diverse, promising equations.\n   - Ensure they meet constraints: non-negative, finite slope at x1=0, and monotonicity for x1 > 0.\n   \n5. Potential new equations:\n   - Consider replacing existing terms or combining them differently to balance complexity and mse.\n   - Ensure new expressions leverage successful structures but vary enough to meet SR-similarity restriction.\n\nNew Equations:\n1. Simple rational: c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)\n2. Combination with log: c[0]*log(1 + x1) + c[1]*x1/(c[2] + x1)\n3. Another form with exp: c[0]*(1 - exp(-x1/c[1])) + c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1)",
