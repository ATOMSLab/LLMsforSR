However, we need to convert this into a form that meets the constraints of non-negative slope and positive slope at the origin.\n\n2. The non-negativity constraint implies that expressions like exp(x1) or square(x1) could be involved, but they should be adjusted to stay non-negative across the range.\n\n3. Initial slope constraint suggests that an expression should grow from zero at a finite rate, implying a form like a linear or polynomial growth at the beginning.\n\n4. Monotonic non-decreasing requirement implies the expression should be strictly increasing for x1 > 0. This means we need to select operators that inherently increase or adjust existing functions to increase.\n\n5. Given the nature of adsorption, a logarithmic or exponential form might be appropriate for modeling the uptake process, as they can model saturation or growth phases.\n\n6. The square root and cube forms could model decaying or growing trends in adsorption.\n\n7. Finally, considering simplicity and short length for expressions, combinations of x1 with these unary operators should be compact.\n\nCandidate expressions:\n- y = sqrt(x1)\n- y = log(x1 + c0)\n- y = x1 / (c0 + x1)",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. We need to satisfy the constraints and restrictions given the dataset. The dataset shows a decreasing trend, which might suggest a function that decreases with increasing x1.\n\n2. The current best-fitting equation with the lowest mse is 'log(x1+c[0])'. Given the constraints, we need expressions that remain non-negative, have a positive initial slope, and are monotonic non-decreasing.\n\n3. The existing equations are:\n   - 'x1/(c[0]+x1)': This is a bounded increasing function.\n   - 'sqrt(x1)': This represents a monotonically increasing curve starting from zero.\n   - 'log(x1+c[0])': A logarithmic function, which could fit well given the positive shift.\n\n4. Possible ideas for new equations:\n   - A rational function similar to 'x1/(c[0]+x1)' but with different configurations.\n   - A combination of square roots or logs that still satisfy the constraints.\n   - A polynomial function that fits within the constraints and isn't too complex.\n\n5. Proposals need to be diverse and not SR-similar to the existing ones. Avoid using the same structure or combination of operators.\n\n6. New candidate equations:\n   - One idea is to explore an expression like `x1 / sqrt(c0 + x1^2)` which could provide a unique form.\n   - Another idea is to explore a fractional form `c0 * x1^2 / (c1 + x1)` that could combine elements of both polynomial and rational functions.\n   - A logarithmic form like `log(c0 * x1 + c1)` might offer a good fit with a logarithmic increase.",

Non-negativity: Ensure y(x1) \u2265 0 for all x1 \u2265 0.\n2. Finite, positive initial slope: As x1 \u2192 0\u207a, y(x1) \u2192 0 and 0 < y'(x1) < \u221e.

This implies the function should be non-decreasing, which fits the adsorption behavior.\n\nRestrictions Analysis:\n\n- Binary operators allowed: +, -, *, /\n- Unary operators allowed: square, cube, sqrt, log, exp\n- No fitting constants directly, but use placeholder constants like c0, c1.\n- Only variable available is x1.\n- Avoid SR-similar expressions to previously suggested ones.\n\nPreviously Suggested Equations:\n\n- Range from simple (e.g., sqrt(x1)) to more complex forms (e.g., c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)).\n- The best equation in terms of mse and complexity was c[0]*log(1+c[1]*x1), with mse = 0.55071139 and complexity = 8.\n\nNew Expression Suggestions:\n\n1.

Use the exponential decay form, which can represent saturation behavior effectively: c0*(1 - exp(-x1/c1)).

Analysis of Existing Equations:\n   - Many current equations involve logarithmic transformations and rational functions.\n   - Lower complexity equations generally have higher MSE.\n   - There is a balance between complexity and error. \n   - Constraints include non-negativity, finite initial slope, and monotonicity.\n   - Restrictions involve using specific operators and avoiding SR-similar expressions.\n\n2. Data Observations:\n   - The data shows a decreasing trend with increasing x1.\n   - The relationship is potentially non-linear and possibly logarithmic or rational in nature.\n   - Initial values are positive and decrease, suggesting a saturation effect.\n\n3. Suggestions for New Equations:\n   - Consider including square or cube terms which are not explored in the existing set.\n   - Explore rational functions with different forms.\n   - Ensure the new equations are not SR-similar to existing ones.\n   - Ensure monotonic increase and non-negativity.\n\nPotential New Equations:\n- A rational function with a square term: c0*x1/(c1 + x1^2)\n- A log-based function with a square root: c0*log(sqrt(x1) + c1)\n- A rational function with a cube term: c0*x1/(c1 + x1^3)",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nTo suggest new expressions, we must focus on minimizing both complexity and loss while ensuring diversity. The dataset has a monotonically decreasing pattern, which suggests a saturation type curve. The previous equations follow this trend, often using logarithmic or rational function forms. We must ensure that the suggested equations satisfy the constraints of non-negativity, finite positive initial slope, and monotonic non-decrease.\n\n1. **Non-negativity and Monotonic Non-decrease**: Logarithmic and rational forms are useful for ensuring non-negativity and a decreasing trend with pressure.\n\n2. **Finite, Positive Initial Slope**: Expressions like those involving logarithms or rational functions typically start from zero and have finite slopes initially.\n\n3. **Avoid SR-similar Expressions**: We should avoid expressions that are simple transformations of each other by fitting constants.\n\nBased on these considerations, let's suggest expressions with diverse forms such as additive combinations, unique ratios, and novel transformations.\n\n- Consider using basic forms like `c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1**2)` but with unique parameter configurations or additional terms to ensure diversity.\n- Try a cubic root transformation or exp transformation in unique combinations to provide the required non-negativity and monotonic properties.\n- Incorporate a combination of terms to ensure complexity is minimized.",
