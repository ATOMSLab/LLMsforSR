      ...Scratch Pad:

From the Pareto front, we can see that the functions with lower complexity have high mean squared error (mse), while the one with slightly higher complexity has a significantly lower mse. Therefore, we need to find the balance between complexity and accuracy. 

Looking at the dataset, it appears to be following an exponential growth pattern. This makes sense, as the semi-major axis distances in a planetary system often follow a specific distribution pattern often referred to as a 'Titius-Bode' law.

Given the restrictions, we should try to stick with combinations of operators which will yield an exponential growth pattern while also maintaining a lower complexity. We should also consider using operators which will allow us to take into account the effect of planetary index on the semi-major axis.

Three potential equations that meet these requirements are:

1. c0 * exp(x1) + c1
2. sqrt(c0) * x1^2 - c1
3. log(c0) + x1^3

These equations are quite diverse: the first is a slightly modified version of the best-performing equation from the Pareto front, the second uses a square root and a squared term to fit the data, and the third uses a logarithm and a cubed term to capture the exponential growth pattern....
