The equation 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' has a lower complexity of 6 and a better mse of 10.45204053. It indicates an exponential growth pattern, a common form in adsorption processes.\n\n3. The equation 'c[0]*x1**c[1]' has the lowest complexity of 5 and a relatively good mse of 1.79274938.

The existing equations range in complexity from 5 to 11, with mse values ranging from 0.122 to 61.878.\n2. The Pareto front shows that simpler models (lower complexity) can achieve a good fit (low mse), but there is a trade-off between complexity and mse.\n3. Consider using combinations of logarithmic, exponential, and power functions with simple linear or polynomial terms to maintain low complexity.\n4. Avoid SR-similar expressions to the ones provided. This means looking for novel combinations or structures that aren't trivially similar to existing ones.\n5. Given the nature of the data (nitrogen adsorption onto mica), consider models that might reflect saturation behaviors, such as rational functions, or models that accommodate rapid changes, such as exponential growth or decay.\n6. Potential expression ideas:\n   - Rational functions with different polynomial degrees in the numerator and denominator.\n   - Combinations of logarithmic and polynomial terms.\n   - Use of square roots for non-linear scaling.\n7. Ensure that new expressions are diverse and capture different potential behaviors in the data.",
