These models typically involve saturation effects and power laws.\n\n2. Consider simple expressions first as they often provide good approximations:\n   - Linear: y = c0 * x1\n   - Quadratic: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1\n   - Exponential: y = c0 * exp(x1) or y = exp(c0 * x1)\n\n3. Incorporate logarithmic and square root transformations to handle potential non-linear saturation:\n   - Logarithmic: y = c0 * log(x1) + c1\n   - Square root: y = c0 * sqrt(x1)\n\n4. Explore reciprocal transformations to model saturation behavior:\n   - Reciprocal: y = c0 / (c1 + x1)\n   - Reciprocal square: y = c0 / (x1^2 + c1)\n\n5. Consider polynomial expressions to capture potential curvature:\n   - Cubic: y = c0 * x1^3 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1\n\n6. Mix and match different transformations to form hybrid models:\n   - Log-Linear: y = c0 * log(x1) + c1 * x1\n   - Exp-Quadratic: y = exp(c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1)\n\nGiven the restrictions, we should try to propose expressions that capture non-linear saturation and are concise.",

The existing equations have complexity ranging from 4 to 8 and mse values from 0.12263081 to 7.17169714.\n\n2. The equations provided use basic mathematical operations and functions. They are already optimized to some degree, so new equations need to explore different mathematical forms to avoid SR-similarity.\n\n3.

To suggest diverse and potentially better equations, we should explore combinations of the allowed operators and functions that deviate from these forms.\n\n5. Potential new forms can incorporate the use of:\n   - Exp function, as it is not used in the existing set.\n   - A combination using subtraction, which is absent in the given equations.\n   - Different arrangements of division that produce a non-SR-similar outcome.\n\n6. Ideas for new equations:\n   - Using exp to explore growth behavior: c[0] * exp(c[1] * x1)\n   - Introducing a subtraction element: c[0] * (x1 - c[1])\n   - A nested function with log for more complexity: c[0] * log(c[1] * x1)\n\n7.
