  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLet's analyze the dataset's behavior. The problem indicates a relationship between pressure (x1) and loading (y), typically observed in adsorption processes. These processes often involve non-linear relationships, which suggests using non-linear transformations or combinations of x1.\n\nThe available operators and functions provide various ways to express these relationships:\n1. Polynomial forms: We can use square or cube of x1 to capture non-linear trends.\n2. Logarithmic forms: log(x1) can help when the data has a multiplicative or exponential pattern.\n3. Exponential forms: exp(x1) can be used if the adsorption process accelerates with pressure.\n4. Rational forms: Expressions like 1/x1 or combinations of x1 in the denominator can model saturation effects.\n\nConsidering these options, let's build candidate expressions without fitting constants directly but allowing for their presence:\n\n1. Polynomial: c0 * x1^2 + c1\n   - This expression captures basic non-linear behavior with a quadratic term.\n\n2. Logarithmic: c0 * log(x1) + c1\n   - Useful for describing data with an exponential rise but leveling off at higher pressures.\n\n3. Rational: c0 / (x1 + c1)\n   - Captures a saturation effect where loading increases rapidly at low pressures but approaches a limit.\n\nThese expressions cater to typical adsorption characteristics on surfaces like mica, where loading may increase non-linearly with pressure, eventually plateauing.",

Strategy for new expressions:\n   - Aim for expressions that explore different functional forms while maintaining low complexity.\n   - Consider transformations such as square root, exponential, and combinations that differ from currently high-performing expressions.\n\n4. Suggestions:\n   - Consider expressions involving square roots or cubes to capture non-linear behavior.\n   - Explore combinations of exponential functions, as they often capture growth behaviors effectively.\n   - Ensure new expressions differ structurally from those suggested previously to avoid SR-similar expressions.\n\n5.
