Lower mse than 0.38, if possible.\n2. Complexity similar to or lower than existing equations (5 to 10).\n3. Diverse forms to avoid SR-similar issues.\n\nConsiderations:\n- Introduce new forms using the allowed operators, while keeping the expressions short.\n- Combine functions creatively to exploit non-linear relationships.\n- Avoid redundancy with the existing equations.\n\nPotential equations:\n1. Using a combination of polynomial and logarithmic functions: 'c0*x1 + c1*log(x1)'. This could potentially balance linear and logarithmic growth.\n2. Using exponential functions can help capture non-linear growth: 'c0 * exp(c1 * x1)'.\n3. Combining square root with polynomial growth: 'c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1 * x1**2'.\n\nThese suggested forms are diverse and introduce new elements not fully explored in the existing set, such as using exponential and linear-polynomial combinations. They aim to capture different aspects of the relationship between pressure and nitrogen loading.",
