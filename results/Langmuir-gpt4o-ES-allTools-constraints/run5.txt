  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Analysis of the Data**:\n   - As `x1` increases, `y` decreases. This suggests a negative relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n   - The pattern resembles a linear or possibly a rational function since it doesn't have sudden changes or exponential growth/decay.\n   - The constraints indicate that at `x1` = 0, `y` should be 0. Therefore, the expression must be structured such that it naturally passes through the origin.\n\n2. **Consider the Constraints**:\n   - **Passes through the origin**: This implies that any constant term is zero or that the function structure inherently leads to zero as `x1` approaches zero.\n   - **Finite, positive initial slope**: The initial slope, dy/dx at `x1` = 0, should be a finite positive value. This implies a linear term with a positive coefficient.\n   - **Monotonic non-decreasing**: The derivative should be non-negative for all `x1 > 0`. This suggests avoiding functions that have turning points or local maxima/minima within the range.\n\n3. **Potential Formulations**:\n   - A simple linear function `y = c0 * x1` satisfies the origin and slope constraints but may not fit the dataset well due to the observed non-linearity.\n   - A rational function like `y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)` can model saturation behavior. It passes through the origin when `x1=0`, and the slope is positive.\n   - Another rational form like `y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + c2 * x1)` can provide more flexibility in fitting.\n   - A polynomial form such as `y = c0 * x1 - c1 * x1^2` can also satisfy constraints but may not fit as neatly without careful choice of constants.\n\n4. **Choosing Expressions**:\n   - The dataset suggests a rational function might be most appropriate due to the saturation-like behavior as `x1` increases.\n   - Ensure that all suggested forms adhere to constraints, especially monotonicity and positive slope at the origin.\n\n5. **Final Expressions**:\n   - Based on the analysis, three potential expressions are:\n     - `y = c0 * x1`\n     - `y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)`\n     - `y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + c2 * x1)`",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Analyze the dataset:\n   - As x1 increases, y decreases. This indicates a negative relationship between x1 and y.\n   - y starts at a higher value and asymptotically approaches a lower bound as x1 increases.\n   - The dataset suggests a non-linear, possibly rational function form.\n\n2. Constraints:\n   - Passes through origin: As x1 \u2192 0\u207a, y(x1) \u2192 0. This means that the function must evaluate to zero when x1 is zero.\n   - Finite, positive initial slope: As x1 \u2192 0\u207a, dy/dx(x1) > 0, which means the slope at the origin is positive and finite.\n   - Monotonic non-decreasing: dy/dx1 \u2265 0 for all x1 > 0.\n\n3. Existing equations:\n   - 'c[0]*x1': Linear, doesn't fit well.\n   - 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+c[2]*x1)': Rational, fits well.\n   - 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)': Simpler rational, same fit as above.\n\n4.

Possible new expressions:\n   - c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1^2): A rational expression that still maintains the origin pass-through.\n   - c0 * x1 / (x1 + c1 * x1): Simplification of existing forms, but checks against SR-similarity.\n   - c0 * x1 / (c1 * x1 + x1^2): Another rational form that maintains positivity and finite slope.\n\n6.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Understand the constraints:\n   - The expression must pass through the origin: y(x1) \u2192 0 as x1 \u2192 0\u207a. This implies that terms involving x1 in the numerator, like x1 or x1^n (n > 0), are required.\n   - The expression should have a finite, positive initial slope. This can be achieved by ensuring the derivative at x1 = 0 is positive and finite.\n   - The expression should be monotonic non-decreasing, implying dy/dx1 \u2265 0 for all x1 > 0.\n\n2. Review existing equations and their MSE:\n   - Analyze existing expressions to avoid SR-similar forms. The best MSE (0.11619437) is achieved in expressions with complexity 15 and 13.\n   - Identify patterns from these equations, such as rational forms where x1 is in the numerator.\n\n3. Generate new expressions:\n   - Consider different forms of the rational expression that meet the constraints.\n   - Use combinations of x1 and x1^n in both the numerator and denominator, ensuring the numerator is a positive power of x1 to satisfy the origin constraint.\n\n4. Diverse expressions:\n   - Explore various combinations to ensure diversity in expressions, avoiding SR-similar forms.\n\nPotential expressions:\n   - y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1 + c2 * x1^2)\n   - y = c0 * x1^2 / (c1 + c2 * x1 + c3 * x1^2)\n   - y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + c2 * x1^2)",
