  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the dataset, we are tasked with finding simple expressions that can approximate the relationship between x1 (pressure) and y (loading) under the constraints provided. Let's go through the constraints and restrictions:\n\n1. **Passes through origin**: The expression must give y = 0 when x1 = 0. This indicates that the expression should not have a constant term, and should be directly proportional to x1.\n\n2. **Finite, positive initial slope**: As x1 approaches 0, the derivative dy/dx1 should be positive and finite. This means that at x1 = 0, the expression must have a positive slope.\n\n3. **Monotonic non-decreasing**: The derivative dy/dx1 should be non-negative for all x1 > 0, implying the expression should not decrease as x1 increases.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's consider potential forms:\n\n- Linear form: y = c0 * x1, which is the simplest form satisfying all constraints. However, the dataset suggests a non-linear relationship.\n\n- Quadratic form: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1**2. This satisfies passing through the origin and can be monotonic non-decreasing with appropriate coefficients.\n\n- Rational form: y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1). This form is often used to model adsorption isotherms and can satisfy all constraints if c0 and c1 are positive.\n\n- Another possible form could be: y = c0 * x1 * (1 - c1 / (c1 + x1)). This expression is derived from the Langmuir isotherm equation and satisfies all constraints as long as c0 > 0 and c1 > 0.\n\nThe dataset appears to be decreasing as x1 increases, which suggests a saturation effect. This is typical in adsorption where y increases rapidly initially but levels off as x1 becomes large.\n\nThus, let's propose three expressions:\n\n1. Simple linear form for baseline understanding.\n2. Quadratic form that captures the increasing nature with diminishing returns.\n3. Rational form that inherently models saturation effects.",

Observations on Given Data:\n   - The dataset suggests a monotonically decreasing relationship between x1 and y.\n   - The previous equations suggest a rational function could fit well, especially with terms like x1/(c + x1) that ensure a finite slope at the origin.\n\n3. Previous Pareto Front Observations:\n   - Simple linear models like c[0]*x1 have high MSE.\n   - Rational functions such as c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) perform well with low complexity.\n   - Polynomials or higher complexity models like c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1**2/(c[2]+x1) slightly improve MSE.\n\n4. New Suggestions:\n   - Focus on rational functions that maintain a simple form but satisfy constraints.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions to previous suggestions.\n   - Expressions like c[0]*x1**2/(c[1]+x1) and c[0]*x1**3/(c[1]+x1**2) offer variety and complexity balance.",

Current Pareto front equations:\n   - Linear equation: 'c[0]*x1' (complexity: 3, mse: 87.902)\n     - Simple, but high mse and doesn't capture the non-linear behavior.\n   - Rational equations:\n     - 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' (complexity: 7, mse: 0.1226)\n     - 'x1/(c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**2)' (complexity: 13, mse: 0.1185)\n   - These provide a good reduction in mse but are more complex.\n\n2. Constraints:\n   - The equation must pass through the origin, which implies that terms without x1 in the numerator should be avoided. This ensures y(0) = 0.\n   - The initial slope should be positive, which means coefficients of x1 in simple terms or the leading term in the numerator of a fraction should be positive.\n   - Monotonic non-decreasing implies a positive or zero derivative, dy/dx, for all x1.\n\n3. Possible new forms:\n   - Since the equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' is already on the Pareto front, try variations that still pass through the origin and are non-decreasing.\n   - Consider forms like:\n     - c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1^2): This introduces a quadratic term in the denominator to possibly capture non-linearity with moderate complexity.\n     - c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]*x1: Adds a linear component to the rational form to improve fit.\n     - c[0]*x1/(c[1]+c[2]*x1^2): Another quadratic variant to explore different curvatures.\n   - Ensure these forms are not SR-similar to existing ones.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Analyze Existing Expressions:\n   - Simple linear form: y = c[0]*x1. Complexity: 3, MSE: 87.90236102. Quite inaccurate.\n   - Rational forms: y = c[0]*x1/(c[1]+c[2]*x1) and y = c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1). Both have low MSE: 0.12263081.\n   - Adding linear component: y = c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1. Complexity: 11, MSE: 0.11864175.\n   - Higher order polynomial in the denominator: y = x1/(c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**2). Complexity: 13, MSE: 0.11856422.\n   - Extended polynomial form: y = c[0]*x1/(c[1]+c[2]*x1+c[3]*x1**2). Complexity: 15, MSE: 0.1185638.\n\n2. Constraints Check:\n   - All suggested equations must pass through the origin, have positive finite initial slope, and be monotonic non-decreasing.\n   - Rational equations inherently satisfy the monotonic non-decreasing requirement if parameters are positive and adequately fitted.\n\n3. Generate New Expressions:\n   - Use a rational form with a simpler denominator to capture the initial slope and monotonic property.\n   - Consider adding a linear part to improve fitting while maintaining simplicity.\n\n4. Proposed Equations:\n   - Rational form with minimal terms: c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)\n   - Rational form with linear component: c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]*x1\n   - Rational form with quadratic term: c[0]*x1/(c[1]+c[2]*x1**2)",
