For non-linear monotonic behavior, consider rational forms: y = c0 / (x1 + c1) or y = c0 * x1 / (x1 + c1).\n4. We can visually see that y decreases as x1 decreases, suggesting inversely proportional behavior.\n5. Another simple form: y = c0 * (x1 + c1) can be considered to ensure non-negative values.\n6.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch pad:\n\nAnalyzing the given dataset patterns and existing equations, it's clear that the relationship is non-linear and likely asymptotic, as the loading does not increase indefinitely with pressure. The constraints and restrictions will guide the choice of new equations. \n\n1. Non-negativity: The equations must ensure that y(x1) \u2265 0 for all x1 \u2265 0. This is naturally satisfied by division or multiplication of positive constants and variables.\n\n2. Finite, positive initial slope: As x1 \u2192 0\u207a, y should approach 0 and maintain a positive derivative. This is typically achieved with terms like c0*x1 or c0*x1/(x1+c1), which are linear near zero.\n\n3. Monotonic non-decrease: A positive derivative for all x1 > 0 can be ensured with expressions where the numerator increases with x1 or the denominator is controlled by positive constants and variables. \n\nThe already provided equations indicate a pattern of rational expressions, which work well under these constraints. Avoiding SR-similar expressions means we need to look for different structural forms while maintaining simplicity.\n\nExisting equations to avoid redundancy:\n- c[0]/(x1+c[1])\n- c[0]*(x1+c[1])\n- c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1])\n\nNew suggestions should vary enough from these structures to avoid SR-similarity, while still being simple and fitting the data well.\n\nPotential new expressions:\n1.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The dataset exhibits a pattern of adsorption isotherms, which are typically modeled by Langmuir or Freundlich equations due to their monotonic behavior. The Pareto front includes equations with varying complexity and accuracy, ranging from simple linear forms to more complex rational functions.\n\n2. Among the existing equations, the best fitting one seems to be the rational function with complexity 9: 'c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1])+c[2]', with an MSE of 0.12213021. It is likely capturing the saturation behavior of adsorption.\n\n3. Constraints to consider:\n   - Non-negativity: All proposed equations must yield positive values for y when x1 is non-negative.\n   - Finite, positive initial slope: The initial slope should be positive and finite as x1 approaches zero.\n   - Monotonic non-decrease: The function should be non-decreasing over the range of x1.\n\n4. Restrictions limit us to basic arithmetic operations and require new equations to be distinct from SR-similar expressions in the existing list.\n\n5. Objective: Minimize complexity while maintaining or improving accuracy. We aim to propose diverse equations that can potentially deliver good fits considering the constraints and restrictions.\n\n6. Potential new equations:\n   - Consider variations of rational functions, possibly incorporating different structures or additional parameters to capture the saturation point more flexibly.\n   - Explore combinations of linear and rational forms that maintain simplicity but offer good fits.\n\n7. New equations proposal:\n   - Equation 1: A simple yet effective rational form could be 'c0 * x1 / (x1 + c1)', which is already present.\n   - Equation 2: Consider another rational form like 'c0 * (x1 + c1) / (x1 + c2)', which introduces two parameters in the numerator to increase flexibility.\n   - Equation 3: Explore a linear combination with a rational form, such as 'c0 * x1 + c1 / (x1 + c2)', which introduces a simple linear term for initial rise and a rational term for saturation behavior.\n   - Equation 4: Consider a variation that combines a linear and an inverse term, such as 'c0 * x1 + c1 / x1', capturing initial linear growth and eventual leveling off.",

A potentially better simple model could be `'c[0] + c[1]*x1'` which can capture a linear trend with an intercept.\n\n2. The equation `'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)'` has complexity 7 and low MSE. To propose another model with similar complexity but different form, consider `'c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1 + 1)'`. This can capture saturation with a different structure.\n\n3. The most complex model `'c[0]*(x1+c[1])/(c[2]+x1)'` has complexity 9. A different approach with the same complexity could be `'c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1 + c[2])'`. This alternative form could offer a different fit by adjusting the denominator's structure.\n\nEnsure all proposed models meet the constraints:\n- Non-negativity: All proposed models ensure non-negative y for x1 >= 0 by their structure.\n- Finite, positive initial slope: As x1 approaches 0, each model's slope can be adjusted to be positive and finite by choosing appropriate constants.\n- Monotonic non-decrease: Each model's derivative with respect to x1 should be non-negative. Proper fitting of constants should satisfy this condition.",
