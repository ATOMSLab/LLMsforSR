The expression should satisfy the constraints of non-negativity, a finite, positive initial slope, and a monotonic non-decrease with respect to x1.\n3. A simple inverse relationship could be modeled by a form such as y = c0 / (x1 + c1), where c0 and c1 are constants. This form can capture the decrease in y as x1 increases.\n4. We can also try expressions like y = c0 - c1 * x1, as this linear form has a negative slope and can model the decrease, but it must be adjusted to maintain non-negativity.\n5. Another potential form is y = c0 / (x1 + c1) + c2, which adds an offset to the inverse relationship for better flexibility.\n6. Since there are restrictions on using constants, we'll assume c0, c1, c2 can be adjusted for fitting.",

The existing suggested expressions have varied complexity levels, and we aim to find new ones with good trade-offs between complexity and accuracy. \n3. Analyzing the list of provided equations, it appears that rational functions (ratios of polynomials) are quite effective for this dataset. \n4. The first equation is linear and has a high mean squared error (MSE), indicating that linearity is not suitable for capturing the pattern.\n5. The second, third, and fifth equations are rational functions of the form c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) with variations. These have lower MSEs, making them promising candidates.\n6. The fourth equation is a sum of two rational functions and is more complex. Although it has a lower MSE, it is not as simple.\n7. The sixth and seventh equations include polynomial terms, providing better fits but with increased complexity.\n8. We need to create diverse equations that are not SR-similar to existing ones and satisfy all constraints.\n9. One potential idea is to explore variations of the Langmuir isotherm model, which is often used for adsorption processes.\n10. We should explore the possibility of using polynomial terms in combination with rational functions to capture the non-linear relationship.\n\nNew Suggestions:\n\n1.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Analyzing the given equations:\n   - The simplest equation is a linear one, \"c[0]-c[1]*x1\", but it has a high MSE of 6.8841212.\n   - The equations involving hyperbolic forms like \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)\" and its variants have lower MSEs and are more complex.\n   - The Pareto front implies that adding terms generally reduces MSE at the cost of increased complexity.\n\n2. Constraints and restrictions:\n   - Non-negativity: The equation should not yield negative values for y when x1 is non-negative.\n   - Finite, positive initial slope: The form should allow for a slope greater than zero and less than infinity as x1 approaches zero.\n   - Monotonic non-decrease: The derivative with respect to x1 should be non-negative for x1 > 0.\n\n3. Suggestions:\n   - We need to balance complexity and MSE while ensuring diversity from existing equations.\n   - Possible approaches might involve variations of rational functions or combinations of linear and rational terms.\n\n4. Avoiding SR-similar expressions:\n   - We need to ensure that the expressions are not equivalent to those already suggested, especially those involving simple transformations of the existing ones.\n\n5. New Expression Ideas:\n   - Given the existing equations, consider alternatives that maintain monotonicity and non-negativity.\n   - Rational functions involving x1^2 might provide new insights while adhering to constraints.",
