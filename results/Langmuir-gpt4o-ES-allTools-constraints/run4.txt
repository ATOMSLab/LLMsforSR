  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch pad:\n\n1. Observing the data, as x1 decreases, y also decreases. This suggests a monotonic relationship between x1 and y. Given that y decreases as x1 decreases, this implies a positive relationship between x1 and y.\n  \n2. Analyzing the constraints:\n   - The expression must pass through the origin, meaning when x1 is 0, y should be 0. This can be ensured by having x1 as a factor in the expression.\n   - The slope of y with respect to x1 should be finite and positive as x1 approaches 0. This suggests a linear or sub-linear initial term.\n   - The relationship should be monotonic non-decreasing, meaning y should not decrease as x1 increases. This excludes expressions like negative powers of x1.\n\n3. The simplest form that satisfies the origin passing and finite initial slope could be a linear relationship: y = c0 * x1. However, since y decreases as x1 decreases, we may need to consider higher-order terms of x1, such as quadratic terms, to better capture the decrease in y as x1 decreases.\n\n4. Potential candidates:\n   - Linear relationship: y = c0 * x1\n   - Quadratic relationship: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2\n   - Rational form: y = c0 * x1 / (1 + c1 * x1)\n\n5. Each expression should ensure that the derivative with respect to x1 remains non-negative:\n   - For y = c0 * x1, dy/dx1 = c0, which is constant and can be positive.\n   - For y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2, dy/dx1 = c0 + 2 * c1 * x1, which is non-negative if c0 and c1 are positive.\n   - For y = c0 * x1 / (1 + c1 * x1), applying the quotient rule ensures a positive derivative if c0 and c1 are positive.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Constraints and Restrictions Analysis:**\n\n   - **Passes through Origin:** The equation must be such that as x1 approaches 0, y(x1) approaches 0. This means there must not be any constant term that doesn't depend on x1.\n   \n   - **Finite, Positive Initial Slope:** The derivative of the equation at x1 = 0 must be finite and positive. This rules out forms with negative exponents of x1 or those that introduce infinity or zero slopes at the origin.\n   \n   - **Monotonic Non-Decreasing:** The derivative must be non-negative for all x1 > 0. This implies the equation should not have any negative derivative terms for positive x1.\n\n2. **Review of Existing Equations:**\n\n   - The simplest form `c[0]*x1` is a linear equation with a positive slope, satisfying all constraints but having a high MSE.\n   \n   - The equation `c[0]*x1/(1+c[1]*x1**2)` introduces a non-linear term and captures diminishing returns at higher pressures, reducing MSE but increasing complexity.\n   \n   - The equation `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+c[2]*x1)` and `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)` both have the same MSE of 0.12263081. These introduce terms in the denominator that effectively capture the saturation effect in adsorption.\n\n3. **Suggestions for New Equations:**\n\n   - Aim to maintain or reduce complexity while lowering MSE.\n   \n   - Need to explore non-linear expressions that can fit within the constraints, such as rational functions or combinations that inherently satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Potential Formulations:**\n\n   - **y1:** `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1**2)` - This modifies the denominator to include x1 squared, potentially capturing different saturation dynamics.\n   \n   - **y2:** `c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1 + 1)` - The addition of x1 in the denominator might provide a different saturation curve.\n   \n   - **y3:** `c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1 + c[2])` - Introduces two coefficients in the denominator, allowing for more flexibility in fitting the saturation behavior.",

Given the dataset, y decreases as x1 increases, indicating an inverse relationship. Equations with terms like `1/(x1 + c)` or similar structures typically capture such behaviors.\n\n4.

Ensure equations are not SR-similar by adjusting the structure:\n   - Use terms like `(x1 + c)` vs `(1 + c*x1)` to maintain structural diversity.\n   - Modify the power of x1 in the denominator to change the curvature and fit.\n\nCandidate Equations:\n- `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1^2)`: introduces a quadratic term in the denominator for different curvature.\n- `c[0]*x1/(1 + c[1]*x1^2)`: another form with a quadratic term that differs structurally.\n- `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + c[2]*x1 + x1**3)`: cubic term introduces new complexity but maintains finite slope.",
