  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. We observe that y decreases as x1 increases. However, the constraints require that the expression we find should be non-decreasing. This implies that we need to consider a transformation of the variables or a different kind of fit.\n\n2. Constraint 1 ensures that the expression is non-negative. This is easy to handle as we can work with expressions that naturally yield non-negative outputs for non-negative inputs.\n\n3. Constraint 2 requires the expression to be zero at x1 = 0 and have a positive slope. This can be achieved with multiplicative expressions of x1, possibly in the denominator.\n\n4. Constraint 3 ensures that the expression is non-decreasing. This is a critical constraint that contradicts the observed data trend. However, simple rational functions with positive coefficients can satisfy this by ensuring the numerator grows faster than the denominator.\n\n5. Given the constraints, simple rational functions such as c0 * x1 / (x1 + c1) could work, where c0 and c1 are constants.\n\n6. The simplest possible expressions considering the constraints could involve transformations of x1, such as inverses or divisions, to ensure monotonicity and positivity.\n\n7. An expression of the form c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1) ensures a positive slope and non-decreasing behavior for positive c0, c1.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe dataset presents a scenario where nitrogen adsorption onto mica is examined by varying pressure (x1) and observing loading (y). The constraints demand that the function is non-negative, has a positive initial slope, and is monotonically non-decreasing. \n\nAnalyzing the existing Pareto front equations:\n1. `c[0]*x1/c[1]`: This is a simple linear function with high MSE, indicating a poor fit. Its main advantage is simplicity.\n2. `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1+c[2])`: It has a low MSE, meaning it fits well, but it is more complex. The addition of c[2] introduces flexibility.\n3. `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)`: This is a slightly simpler version of the second equation but has the same MSE, suggesting redundancy.\n\nTo suggest new expressions, we aim for simplicity but also a good fit. The task is to explore diverse forms of equations that abide by the constraints and restrictions.\n\n1. Consider a form similar to Michaelis-Menten kinetics: `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)`. Since this form is already on the Pareto front, variations could be:\n   - Introduce another term in the denominator: `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1 + c[2]*x1)`, allowing for more flexibility while keeping complexity low.\n   \n2. Explore another simple form by slightly modifying the linear function:\n   - Add a constant to the numerator: `(c[0] + x1)/(c[1] + x1)`. This maintains non-negativity and allows for a curve that can fit better than a strict linear form.\n   \n3. Consider a completely different approach, such as a quadratic form, but ensure it remains monotonic:\n   - `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1^2)`, which introduces a quadratic term in the denominator for more complex behavior.\n\nThese forms are diverse, potentially offering a balance between fit and simplicity without being SR-similar to each other or existing solutions.",

The simplest form, \"c[0]*x1/c[1]\", has high MSE, indicating it doesn't capture the saturation behavior well.\n\n3. The equation \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)\" holds promise, as it is simple but fits the data well with low MSE. This represents a Langmuir-type isotherm.\n\n4.

Introducing additional terms involving higher powers or ratios, like \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1\" or \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1**3\", can capture more complex behavior but at the cost of complexity.\n\n6.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the constraints and restrictions, we need to develop expressions that are non-negative for all x1 \u2265 0, have a finite positive initial slope, and are monotonic non-decreasing. The operations we can use are limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nAnalyzing the given Pareto front, we have several candidate expressions to draw inspiration from. The simplest form, c[0]*x1/c[1], has a high MSE, indicating poor fit. More complex forms like c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1**2) achieve lower MSE but at the cost of higher complexity. We need to find a balance between complexity and accuracy.\n\nObserving the dataset, y appears to increase initially and gradually levels off as x1 increases, which resembles a typical adsorption isotherm. The Langmuir isotherm is a common model for such behavior and is typically represented as c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1). This form shows up in several of the given expressions and serves as a good base.\n\nTo create diverse expressions, we can consider:\n1. Starting with the Langmuir form and adding a linear term to account for possible linear growth.\n2. Utilizing multiple Langmuir-like terms with different parameters to capture more complex adsorption behavior.\n3. Introducing terms like (c[0]*x1^2)/(c[1]+x1) to explore non-linear growth patterns.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can propose new expressions by tweaking known adsorption models or by combining them.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nAnalyzing the dataset and the previously suggested equations, I observe the following:\n\n1. **Equation Complexity vs. MSE Trade-off**:\n   - Lower complexity models have higher MSE, which indicates a poorer fit.\n   - More complex models generally have lower MSE, indicating better fits, but they also introduce more parameters, leading to potential overfitting.\n\n2. **Constraints and Restrictions**:\n   - The constraints ensure that the models need to be non-negative, have a finite and positive initial slope, and be monotonic non-decreasing.\n   - The restrictions limit the operations to simple arithmetic operations and prohibit fitting constants directly.\n\n3. **Existing Models**:\n   - The simplest model `c[0]*x1/c[1]` is quite inaccurate (high MSE). It only captures a basic linear relationship.\n   - The models using `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)` as a base are more accurate due to their non-linear nature, which better captures the adsorption behavior.\n   - Adding terms like `c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1)` or `c[2]*x1` introduces further complexity for better fit but at the cost of additional parameters.\n\n4. **Suggestions for New Equations**:\n   - Aim for a balance between complexity (to avoid overfitting) and lower MSE (better fit).\n   - Ensure diversity by introducing different structural elements.\n\n5. **Suggestions**:\n   - Consider using sum of simpler terms to maintain low complexity while attempting to capture non-linear behavior.\n   - Introduce diversity by using different combinations of x1 and constants.\n\nGiven these observations, I propose the following new equations:",
