The dataset suggests a non-linear relationship between x1 (pressure) and y (loading), which is typical for adsorption isotherms. \n\nThe constraints require the function to be non-negative, have a positive finite initial slope, and be monotonic non-decreasing. These suggest forms similar to Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms. The equations should not be SR-similar to the given ones, meaning they should introduce a distinct form or structure.\n\n1. Starting with a simple linear form is often a good baseline, but to add diversity and satisfy constraints, rational and polynomial forms may be more suitable.\n2. Consider forms like `c0*x1/(c1 + x1)` which are often used in isotherm models.\n3. A polynomial could be `c0*x1 + c1*x1^2` which adds non-linearity but still maintains a certain simplicity.\n4. Adding diversity by using a form like `c0*(x1 + c1)/(x1 + c2)` which can introduce a different structure and still satisfy the conditions.\n\nNow, let's propose three potential equations:\n\n1.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe task is to develop expressions that fit the provided dataset while adhering to the constraints and restrictions. The dataset represents nitrogen adsorption onto mica, with pressure (x1) as the independent variable and loading (y) as the dependent variable.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The data suggests a non-linear relationship where y decreases as x1 increases, following a saturation-like curve.\n2. Constraints require the function to be non-negative, with a positive initial slope and monotonic non-decreasing behavior.\n3. Given the restrictions on operators and prohibition of fitting constants within the expressions, we need to strategically use x1 and constants (c0, c1, etc.) to build potential models.\n\nAnalysis of provided equations:\n- The simplest equation, 'c[0]*x1', has high MSE and doesn't capture the saturation behavior.\n- The more complex equations introduce fractions, which allow modeling of saturation effects.\n- The equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' already achieves a low MSE, indicating that adding a constant to the denominator helps model the saturation curve effectively.\n- More complex models with quadratic terms in the denominator ('c[0]*x1/(c[1]+c[2]*x1+x1**2)') further reduce MSE, suggesting that incorporating quadratic terms can improve the fit.\n\nTo propose new equations, we aim to:\n1. Explore variations of existing successful models, particularly those involving x1 in both numerator and denominator to represent saturation.\n2. Maintain diversity in complexity, with an emphasis on simplicity for practicality.\n\nPotential New Equations:\n1. A variation of the simplest saturation model, but with an additional constant added to the numerator to allow for initial offset: c0*(x1 + c1)/(c2 + x1).\n2. A model with a quadratic term in both numerator and denominator to represent more complex saturation behavior: c0*(x1 + c1)/(c2 + x1 + c3*x1**2).\n3.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Starting with the simplest expression, the linear equation 'c[0]*x1' has a high MSE, indicating it doesn't capture the non-linear nature of the data. Thus, it isn't suitable for prediction.\n\n2. The expression 'c[0]*x1+c[1]' has a reduced MSE, but it's still linear and doesn't account for non-linear behavior effectively.\n\n3. The expression 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' is a rational function with a lower MSE, which implies it captures the curvature of the data better.\n\n4. The expression 'c[0]*(x1+c[1])/(c[2]+x1)' further reduces the MSE with moderate complexity, suggesting it captures the data's behavior more accurately.\n\n5. The expression 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1' combines linear and non-linear elements, resulting in a slightly better fit but with more complexity.\n\n6. The most complex expression 'c[0]*(x1+c[1])/(c[2]+x1+c[3]*x1**2)' has the lowest MSE, indicating it captures the data nuances well but is quite complex.\n\nTo suggest new expressions, we need to balance complexity and MSE reduction. We should aim for diverse equations that aren't SR-similar to existing ones.\n\n- Try a simple expression that adds a constant to a fraction: 'c[0]/(x1 + c[1]) + c[2]'.\n- Consider a slightly more complex rational function with a quadratic term: 'c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1 + c[2]*x1**2)'.\n- Experiment with a simple sum of fractions: 'c[0]/(x1 + c[1]) + c[2]/(x1 + c[3])'.\n\nThese expressions should provide diverse options with a range of complexities and non-linear characteristics.",
