This implies no constant term in the expression.\n   - Finite, positive initial slope: The derivative dy/dx must be finite and positive at x1 = 0.\n   - Monotonic non-decreasing: The derivative dy/dx must be non-negative for all x1 > 0.\n\n3. **Exploring Possible Forms:**\n   - Linear Form: y = c0 * x1. This is the simplest form that passes through the origin and has a constant positive slope.\n   - Quadratic Form: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2. This allows for slight curvature while still respecting the origin and initial slope constraints.\n   - Rational Function: y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1). This can model saturation behavior, where y levels off as x1 increases.\n\n4. **Satisfying Constraints:**\n   - The linear form inherently satisfies all constraints.\n   - The quadratic form, with positive coefficients, can satisfy all constraints.\n   - The rational form can be structured to satisfy constraints, especially if c1 is positive to ensure finite slope at the origin.\n\n5. **Simplification:**\n   - All forms should be considered with the simplest possible number of parameters to avoid overfitting and maintain interpretability.\n   - The linear and quadratic forms are particularly simple and interpretable.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The dataset suggests a non-linear relationship between pressure (x1) and loading (y). The existing equations indicate that a simple linear model is insufficient, as indicated by the high MSE for the simplest model (c[0]*x1). More complex models have lower MSE, indicating a better fit.\n\n2. The previous equations include a quadratic term and a rational function. The second equation (c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2) suggests that a polynomial approach might be effective. The third equation (c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)) shows that rational functions provide a good fit with moderate complexity.\n\n3. Given the constraints:\n   - The model must pass through the origin: This implies that any constant term (intercept) must be zero.\n   - Finite, positive initial slope: The first derivative at x1 = 0 must be a positive constant.\n   - Monotonic non-decreasing: The derivative should be non-negative for all x1 > 0.\n\n4. Consider alternative forms of equations that satisfy these constraints:\n   - A simple linear function like c0*x1, although it is already given and has a high MSE.\n   - A rational function like c0*x1/(c1+x1^2) could be interesting as it introduces a different form of rationality.\n   - A polynomial form like c0*x1 + c1*x1^3, which introduces higher-order terms while maintaining simplicity.\n   - A form like x1/(c0 + x1) which is different from the rational form given could be another option.\n\n5. Ensure diversity in suggestions:\n   - Use a combination of polynomial and rational functions.\n   - Explore different combinations that are not SR-similar to each other.",

The equations that fit this type of data often involve saturation terms that can be modeled by rational functions.\n\nConstraints and considerations:\n1.

The initial slope must be finite and positive, which implies a linear term in x1 in the numerator.\n3. The function must be monotonic non-decreasing, meaning the derivative with respect to x1 must be non-negative.\n\nAnalyzing the provided equations:\n- The simpler equations are often more desirable if they maintain a low mean squared error (MSE).\n- The equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' is promising due to its simplicity and low MSE, suggesting it's a good baseline.\n- The equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+sqrt(x1))' is also interesting due to its simplicity and relatively low MSE, suggesting it effectively captures the saturation behavior without being overly complex.\n- The equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+sqrt(c[2]+x1))' has the lowest MSE, indicating it captures the data well, but it is more complex.\n\nTo generate new equations:\n- Consider variations on these forms that can capture the behavior with lower complexity while still maintaining or improving the fit.\n\nLet's consider:\n1. A form similar to 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' but slightly varied to see if we can capture the behavior with even fewer terms or a different balance.\n2. Incorporating different polynomial terms in the denominator to see if that provides a better fit with lower complexity.\n3.

Constraints:\n   - Passes through origin: y = c0*x1 is a simple form that satisfies this.\n   - Finite, positive initial slope: y = c0*x1 shows a positive slope.\n   - Monotonic non-decreasing: Given y = c0*x1, its derivative dy/dx = c0, which is constant and non-decreasing.\n\n2. Existing Equations:\n   - c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) and similar forms adhere to the constraints.\n   - Complexity and mse are key considerations; simpler expressions are preferred if they provide a reasonable fit.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions.\n\n3. New Expression Suggestions:\n   - Consider simple rational functions or linear forms which have shown good performance in the given context.\n   - c0*x1/(c1 + x1) is a common form meeting most criteria. Try variations that are not SR-similar.\n\nNew Expressions:\n- y = c0*x1/(c1 + x1) is common, so avoid exact repetitions or SR-similar forms.\n- Consider adding or adjusting terms to explore different parameter spaces.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The expression should pass through the origin: as x1 \u2192 0\u207a, y(x1) \u2192 0. This implies that there cannot be any constant terms independent of x1.\n   - The initial slope should be finite and positive: when x1 \u2192 0\u207a, dy/dx(x1) > 0. Therefore, the expression should start with a linear term with a positive coefficient or an equivalent form.\n   - The expression should be monotonic non-decreasing: for all x1 > 0, dy/dx1 \u2265 0. This means that the derivative of the expression with respect to x1 should not be negative.\n   \n2. **Analysis of Provided Equations:**\n   - Many of the provided equations have a form involving x1 in both the numerator and denominator, which allows them to pass through the origin and ensures a positive initial slope.\n   - The most complex yet accurate equations have more terms in the denominator, often involving combinations of x1, constant terms, and sometimes square or square root terms.\n   - Less complex equations use simpler forms like c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1), which satisfies the constraints but may not capture all data nuances.\n   \n3. **Proposed Equation Structures:**\n   - Consider using rational functions, maintaining a simple linear term in the numerator to ensure the origin constraint and a denominator that allows flexibility for fitting.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions to those provided, such as simple linear forms or direct rational forms already seen.\n\n4. **Constructing New Equations:**\n   - Use combinations of x1, c0, c1, etc., in both numerator and denominator while ensuring constraints.\n   - Ensure diversity in structures by altering forms significantly from provided equations.\n\nPossible new expressions:\n- c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1**2): This form maintains constraints and has a different structure.\n- c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1 + x1**2): Similar to one provided but adds x1 squared for more flexibility.\n- c0 * x1 / (c1 + c2 * x1 + x1**2): Adds another constant for better fitting, ensuring it's not SR-similar to any provided equation.",
