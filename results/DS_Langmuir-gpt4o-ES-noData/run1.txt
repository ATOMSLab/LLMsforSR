  1. Understanding the dataset: \n   
  - The task is to find expressions that describe the relationship between pressure (x1) and 
  loading (y) in the adsorption process.   
  - The goal is to approximate loading (y) as a function of pressure (x1), using the constraints provided.
  2. Model considerations:   
  - The expressions should be simple and interpretable.\n   
  - Given the context of adsorption, the Langmuir isotherm model might be a potential candidate, 
  which typically follows a form like y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1).\n   
  - Other potential models could include linear, polynomial, or rational forms, considering the 
  constraints on operators and constants.\n\n
  3. Initial thoughts on expressions:\n   
  - Linear model: y = c0 * x1 + c1\n   - Rational model: y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1)\n   
  - Polynomial model: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 (simplified to allowed operations)\n\
  4. Testing different forms:\n   
  - Linear form might be too simplistic and not capture saturation.\n   
  - Rational forms could capture saturation behavior.\n   
  - Quadratic or other polynomial forms can provide a curve but may not reflect saturation.\n\n
  5. Finalizing potential expressions:\n   
  - Expression 1: Linear form, which could serve as a baseline or initial approximation.\n   
  - Expression 2: Rational form resembling Langmuir isotherm.\n   
  - Expression 3: A polynomial form within the constraints to capture non-linear behavior.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nTo generate new equations that are diverse and potentially better than the provided ones, we need to focus on simplicity and accuracy while considering the restrictions.\n\n1. Starting with simple linear and quadratic forms is a good approach since they are both simple and frequently effective. The equation `c[0]*x1 + c[1]` is simple, but we can explore slight modifications or additions to make it potentially more accurate.\n\n2. The existing quadratic form `c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1*x1` is already quite complex. We should try simpler quadratic forms or variations.\n\n3. Rational functions have shown good performance (e.g., `(c[0]+c[1]*x1)/(c[2]+x1)`). We can explore other rational forms, ensuring they are not SR-similar to this. Perhaps a form like `c[0]/(c[1] + x1)` or `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1*x1)` could be interesting.\n\n4. The complexity should ideally be kept low, aiming for a balance between the complexity and the mean squared error.\n\n5. Explore forms that combine linear and inverse terms for diversity.\n\nLet's generate some equations based on these ideas:\n\n1. A slightly modified linear equation that combines linear and inverse terms: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]/x1`\n2. A new quadratic form that modifies the existing quadratic: `c[0]*x1*x1 + c[1]`\n3.

  The goal is to create new expressions that balance complexity and MSE. The expressions should not be SR-similar to existing ones.
  Observation:
  - Equations 5, 6, and 7 have the same MSE but different complexities. This indicates a potential optimal range for MSE.
  - Equation 4 has the lowest MSE with a balanced complexity. 
  - Equations 2 and 1 are simpler but have higher MSE.
  To minimize redundancy:- We should avoid structures like simple linear terms (like equation 2) or a single division (like equation 1).
  We can explore adding and dividing terms, while keeping complexity low.
  - Using combinations of terms like x1, x1*x1 in different ways might avoid SR-similarity.
  Suggestions:\n
  - Consider forms that involve both numerator and denominator terms with simple additions and multiplications to keep complexity balanced.
  - We can explore the use of quadratic terms or combinations that were not fully utilized in the earlier equations.

  1. Use a form with nested fractions: c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]/(x1*(c[3]+x1))\n
  2. A quadratic term in both numerator and denominator: (c[0]*x1*x1 + c[1]*x1)/(c[2] + c[3]*x1)\n
  3. A simpler multiple fraction term: c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1) + c[2]*x1/(c[3] + x1)",

The equations provided have varying complexities from 5 to 19 and the MSE values range from 0.03418604 to 0.00010791.\n3. We should aim to provide equations that are not SR-similar to any in the given list.\n4. The acceptable operators are +, -, *, and /, with only one independent variable x1.\n5. Constants c0, c1, etc., are used as placeholders for fitting.\n\nLet's analyze the list:\n\n- The simplest equation 'c[0]*x1-c[1]' has a high MSE of 0.03418604, suggesting a linear approach is inadequate.\n- Equations with terms like x1 in the denominator (e.g., 'c[0]/(x1+c[1])+c[2]') have lower MSE, indicating the need for non-linear terms.\n- The lowest MSE equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1**2)+c[2]-c[3]*x1/(c[4]+x1)' has high complexity (19). We should aim to reduce complexity while maintaining a reasonable MSE.\n\nLet's propose new, diverse expressions:\n\n1. Consider an equation with an inverse relationship and a linear term:\n   - A form like 'c[0]/(x1+c[1]) + c[2]*x1' could capture non-linear behavior while keeping complexity moderate.\n\n2. A reciprocal function with a subtraction to introduce more non-linearity:\n   - 'c[0]/(c[1]+x1) - c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1)' could introduce a different kind of non-linear fitting.\n\n3. A product of a linear and reciprocal term:\n   - 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1)' to explore interaction between linear and reciprocal terms.\n\nThese suggestions aim to cover a diverse range of non-linear behaviors with varying complexities.",
