  **Understanding the Dataset Context:** \n   - The dataset describes the relationship between the pressure (independent variable, x1) 
  and the loading of isobutane onto silicalite (dependent variable, y) at a constant temperature.\n   
  - Typically, adsorption processes can show nonlinear relationships like Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms, 
  but we are limited to algebraic expressions using basic operators.\n\n2. 
  **Possible Functional Forms:**\n   - Given the constraints, we cannot directly use typical isotherm equations, 
  but we can approximate with simple algebraic forms.\n   
  - We can consider polynomial forms, rational functions, and other combinations of x1.\n\n3. 
  **Polynomial Approximations:**\n   - A simple polynomial could capture the trend if it\u2019s relatively smooth.\n   
  - For instance, `y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2` could approximate some nonlinear trends.\n\n4. 
  **Rational Functions:**\n   - These can capture asymptotic behavior which might be relevant for adsorption isotherms.\n   
  - For example, `y = c0*x1 / (c1 + x1)` is reminiscent of the Langmuir isotherm.\n\n
  5. **Analysis:**\n   - The expressions should be simple yet able to capture a possibly saturating curve due to physical adsorption 
  limits.\n   - Identify simple transformations of x1 that could represent the potential saturation or initial linear increase.\n\n
  6. **Expression Candidates:**\n   - Based on common trends in adsorption and allowed operators, consider these forms:\n     
  - `y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)` for saturation-like behavior.\n     
  - `y = c0 * x1 + c1` for a simple linear trend.\n     
  - `y = c0 * x1 * x1 + c1 * x1 + c2` for polynomial behavior.",

I need to suggest new equations that are diverse and strike a balance between complexity and mse. Let's analyze the current equations:\n\n1. Linear equation: 'c[0]*x1+c[1]', which is simple but has a relatively high mse.\n2. Rational functions: These include expressions like 'c[0]*(x1/(c[1]+x1))+c[2]' and 'c[0]/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]', which have lower mse and moderate complexity.\n3. More complex rational functions: These have additional terms or more complex denominators, such as 'c[0]+(c[1]*x1)/(c[2]+x1)-c[3]/x1', which further reduce mse at the cost of increased complexity.\n\nTo suggest new equations, I should consider the following:\n- Use rational expressions as they generally offer a good trade-off between fit and complexity.\n- Avoid SR-similar expressions by ensuring the new forms are not reducible to existing ones through constant fitting.\n- Introduce diversity by considering different forms, such as varying the structure of the numerator and denominator.\n\nI will explore:\n- A new combination of terms in the numerator and denominator to create a rational function.\n- A polynomial form that introduces non-linear behavior without excessive complexity.\n- A nested rational function that uses both addition and subtraction, possibly with different structures in the numerator and denominator.\n\nPotential new expressions:\n1. 'c[0] + x1/(c[1] + c[2]*x1) + c[3]/(x1 + c[4])': A rational function with two terms, likely to be different from the existing ones.\n2. 'c[0] + c[1]*x1^2/(c[2] + c[3]*x1) + c[4]/x1': Introduces a polynomial term in the numerator, offering a different form.\n3.
