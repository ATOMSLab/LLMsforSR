  1. Understanding the dataset: 
   
  - The task is to find expressions that describe the relationship between pressure (x1) and 
  loading (y) in the adsorption process.   
  - The goal is to approximate loading (y) as a function of pressure (x1), using the constraints provided.
  2. Model considerations:   
  - The expressions should be simple and interpretable.
   
  - Given the context of adsorption, the Langmuir isotherm model might be a potential candidate, 
  which typically follows a form like y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1).
   
  - Other potential models could include linear, polynomial, or rational forms, considering the 
  constraints on operators and constants.


  3. Initial thoughts on expressions:
   
  - Linear model: y = c0 * x1 + c1
   - Rational model: y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1)
   
  - Polynomial model: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 (simplified to allowed operations)
  4. Testing different forms:
   
  - Linear form might be too simplistic and not capture saturation.
   
  - Rational forms could capture saturation behavior.
   
  - Quadratic or other polynomial forms can provide a curve but may not reflect saturation.


  5. Finalizing potential expressions:
   
  - Expression 1: Linear form, which could serve as a baseline or initial approximation.
   
  - Expression 2: Rational form resembling Langmuir isotherm.
   
  - Expression 3: A polynomial form within the constraints to capture no...

Let's analyze the current Pareto front:

   - Complexity: 7, MSE: 0.04670168

2. c[0]*x1-c[1]

3. c[0]*(x1/(c[1]+x1))+c[2]*(x1/(c[3]+x1*x1))
   - Complexity: 17, MSE: 0.00506452

4. c[0]*(x1+c[1])/(c[2]+x1)

7. c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)-c[2]/(c[3]+x1**2)
   - Complexity: 15, MSE: 0.00023392

Our goal is to suggest new equations with minimal complexity and loss. The current expressions are diverse, but we need to add more diversity while maintaining low MSE and complexity. Let's explore some potential expressions:

- Consider using combinations and variations of existing forms without redundancy.
- Use the fact that adsorption often follows Langmuir or Freundlich-like isotherms, which have rational forms.
- Explore new terms or combinations that might capture additional variance without increasing complexity too much.
- Avoid SR-similar expressions by ensuring any new formula can't be reduced or transformed into an existing one through constant fitting.

Potential Suggestions:

1. A single fraction with a linear term in the numerator and a quadratic term in the denominator:
   - c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1 + c[2]*x1**2)

2. A rational form with multiple linear terms:
   - (c[0]*x1 + c[1])/(c[2] + c[3]*x1)

3. An expression combining linear and inverse terms:
   - c[0]*x1 + c[1]/(c[2] + x1)

Ensure these are not SR-similar to the existing equations by confirming their unique structural form, even after potential constant adjustments....

  3. The task is to suggest three new equations that are not SR-similar to existing ones and maintain diversity while considering 
  the constraints.


  4. Review existing patterns:
   
  - Linear terms of x1 (e.g., c[0]*x1)
   
  - Inverse terms of x1 (e.g., c[1]/x1)
   
  - Rational expressions (e.g., c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1**2))
   
  5. Consider combinations or transformations that have not been utilized yet, such as:
   
  - Quadratic terms (e.g., x1**2)
   
  - Nested fractions or combinations involving sums and products.
  6. Propose diverse equations:
   
  - Use combinations that are not trivial transformations of existing ones, e.g., avoid simple linear combinations if they've been 
  exhausted.
   
  - Consider forms that might fit well with isobutane adsorption, such as Langmuir or Freundlich isotherm-inspired forms.

1. 
  The relationship between pressure (x1) and loading (y) is often non-linear in adsorption processes. We should look for polynomial, 
  rational, or simple multiplicative expressions.

2. Simple linear expression: y = c0 * x1. 
  This assumes a direct proportional relationship. Useful as a baseline.

3. 
  Quadratic expression: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2. Captures curvature in the data, which is common in adsorption isotherms.


  4. Rational expression: y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1). This form is reminiscent of Langmuir isotherms, accounting for saturation at 
  high pressures.

      ...1. **Analysis of the Dataset:**

- The dataset revolves around the adsorption of isobutane onto 
  silicalite at a constant temperature, with x1 representing pressure and y representing loading.

  - The relationship between adsorption (y) and pressure (x1) is often nonlinear and can be described using various isotherm models 
  such as Langmuir, Freundlich, or Temkin.

  - The Langmuir isotherm model is characterized by saturation behavior at high pressures, which can be represented as 
  y = (a * x1) / (b + x1), where a and b are constants.
- 
  The Freundlich isotherm represents adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces and can be approximated by y = a * (x1^b), where a and b are 
  constants.
- The Temkin isotherm assumes indirect adsorbate/adsorbate interactions and can be represented as y = a * ln(c * x1).
  
- Given the restrictions on operators and the requirement to use only basic arithmetic, we need to simplify the 
  possible expressions.

2. **Candidate Models:**

- **Model 1: Linear Fractional Model**: This model captures saturation behavior, 
  typical for Langmuir-type adsorption, using a simple fractional form: y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1).
- **Model 2: Basic Power Model**: A simple form that captures non-linear behavior using a power law: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2. This captures potential quadratic growth.

  **Understanding the Dataset Context:** 
   - The dataset describes the relationship between the pressure (independent variable, x1) 
  and the loading of isobutane onto silicalite (dependent variable, y) at a constant temperature.
   
  - Typically, adsorption processes can show nonlinear relationships like Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms,

2. To suggest new equations, we need to aim for a better or comparable mse while maintaining or reducing complexity. 

3. The simplest equation in the list is `c[0]*x1+c[1]` with a complexity of 5, but its mse is relatively higher at 0.03418604. Using linear terms can yield low complexity but often results in higher mse.

4. The equation `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]` and `c[0]/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]` have the second-best mse but with slightly different complexity. These are likely based on the Langmuir model, which is common for adsorption isotherms.

5. To create diverse and potentially effective equations, we can:
   - Utilize polynomial terms with division or addition to introduce non-linearity.
   - Consider inverted or reciprocal terms of x1, which often help in capturing asymptotic behavior.
