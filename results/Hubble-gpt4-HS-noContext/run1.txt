The y values first decrease, then increase, reach a peak, decrease again and finally increase. This pattern suggests that the underlying equations might involve polynomial terms or exponential terms or both. The degree of the polynomial and the base of the exponential function can be represented by constants c0, c1, etc.\n\nAs the first step, I shall try to fit a polynomial equation of the form y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2. This equation has a quadratic term, a linear term and a constant term, and can potentially capture the non-linear relationships in the data.\n\nNext, I will attempt to fit an exponential equation of the form y = c0*exp(c1*x1). This equation can capture the exponential growth and decay in the data.\n\nFinally, I will try a combined polynomial and exponential equation of the form y = c0*x1^2 + c1*exp(c2*x1).

Also, we want diverse equations to avoid redundancy.\n\nGiven that x1 varies from 0.032 to 2.006, it seems that we can use both low and high powers of x1. Also, the unary operators such as sqrt, log, and exp may be useful as they can capture non-linear patterns. \n\nConsidering the restrictions and the existing equations in the Pareto front, the following three equations can be proposed:\n\n1. An equation with a cubic term and a square root: 'c[0]*x1**3+c[1]*sqrt(x1)' \n   This equation has a complexity of 11 and includes both a high power term and a square root, which could capture different patterns in the data.\n\n2. An equation with an exponential term and a linear term: 'c[0]*exp(x1)+c[1]*x1**2' \n   This equation has a complexity of 9 and includes both an exponential and a quadratic term, which could capture non-linear growth patterns.\n\n3. An equation with a square term and a linear term: 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1'\n   This equation has a complexity of 8 and includes both a quadratic and a linear term, which could capture both linear and quadratic patterns in the data.\n\nThese three equations are diverse and have relatively low complexity, which should make them useful for this dataset and problem.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the previous equations and the given data, we can see a few patterns. The mean squared errors (mse) decrease as complexity increases which is expected as more complex models can better fit the data. However, the goal here is to minimize both complexity and loss. As such, we want to focus on finding equations that are simpler but still perform well. \n\nLooking at the data, it seems that the dependent variable y increases as x1 increases. This suggests that there might be a positive relationship between x1 and y. Given this, it might be beneficial to include terms that increase as x1 increases such as x1, x1^2, and x1^3. \n\nHowever, we also want to avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions. This means we should avoid using the same operators in the same way as previous equations. So, for example, we should avoid using the square operator on x1 as it was used in the equation 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)+c[1]*x1**2'. Similarly, we should avoid using the cube operator on x1 as it was used in the equation 'c[0]*x1**3+c[1]*x1**2'.\n\nConsidering these factors, I suggest three new equations that could potentially minimize both complexity and loss.",
