    [keyword] 'Bode'
      ...The dataset seems to show an exponential relation. The values of 'y' are increasing rapidly with respect to 'x1'. Since we are dealing with a planetary system where 'x1' is the planet index and 'y' is the semi-major axis, the relationship could be described by the Titius-Bode law. However, as the law involves constants and we are not allowed to fit constants, we'll have to find a more general expression. The exponential relationship suggests that some form of x1^c0 or e^(c1*x1) may fit the data well....
