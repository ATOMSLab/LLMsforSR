However, we also need to consider the complexity of the equations. \n\nGiven that we are only allowed to use the operators: +, -, *, /, ^ and exp, and avoiding SR-similar expressions, I suggest the following three new equations:\n\n1. A simple linear equation with a power of x1. Even though a similar equation exists on the Pareto front, this equation uses a different power of x1 and therefore isn't SR-similar.\n2. A more complex equation combining multiplication, division and exponential. This might lead to a better fit while still maintaining a reasonable complexity.\n3. Lastly, an equation combining addition, division and powers. This equation is diverse from the existing ones on the Pareto front and might provide new insights.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided Pareto front, it is clear that the mean squared error decreases as the complexity of the equation increases. However, there are significant jumps in reduction of MSE as we move from a complexity of 3 to 4 and again from 6 to 7. After this, the decrease in MSE is less pronounced. \n\nThe data is about a planetary system where the x1 variable is the planet index and the y variable is the semi-major axis. Given the nature of the data, it is likely that the relationship between these variables is non-linear and possibly exponential. \n\nThe provided equations already cover a good range of structures, including linear (c[0]*x1), inverse (c[0]/(x1+1)), quadratic (c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2), and exponential forms (c[0]*exp(x1/c[1])). \n\nTo offer diverse suggestions that are not SR-similar to existing ones and maintain a balance between complexity and MSE, I can propose the following equations:\n\n1. An equation that includes a square root transformation on the independent variable, which can sometimes model non-linear relationships effectively. However, given the restrictions this can be approximated by raising to power of 0.5, which is equivalent to square root. For simplicity, we will use power of 2. \n\n2. An equation that includes an interaction term between the independent variable and its square. This can model situations where the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable changes as the independent variable increases.\n\n3. An equation that includes an exponential term with a negative exponent, which can model situations where the dependent variable decreases rapidly as the independent variable increases.",
