  "LLM Thoughts": "From the provided dataset, we can see that the dependent variable 'y' increases as the independent variable 'x1' increases. The equations provided in the Pareto front also indicate some patterns, including the use of square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp operations on 'x1'. \n\nThe equation with the least mean square error (mse) and the least complexity is 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*log(x1))' with complexity 7 and mse of 30526.24562766. The equations with less mse but greater complexity are 'c[0]*x1**3+c[1]*x1+c[2]*log(x1)' and 'c[0]*x1**3+c[1]*x1+c[2]', with complexities 14 and 11 respectively. \n\nConsidering the need to provide diverse equations, it's important to introduce some variations in the operations applied to 'x1' while also considering their effect on mse. \n\nSince the equations already include various unary operations applied to 'x1', we can try some variations in the binary operations. For instance, we can create an equation with 'x1' in the denominator (since most of the equations have 'x1' in the numerator), and another equation combining 'x1' with log or sqrt operations. \n\nTaking into account the SR-similarity restrictions, we should avoid equations that can be simplified to the same form after fitting constants.",
