  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the dataset, it seems that the relationship between y and x1 could be a polynomial one. As x1 increases, y also increases, but not linearly. The polynomial could be of 2nd or 3rd degree. The values of y do not seem to be oscillatory or periodic, ruling out sine or cosine functions. The dataset does not contain negative values for y, so logarithmic and square root functions might not be relevant. Exponential function could also be a potential choice as the growth seems to be more rapid as x1 increases. \n\nPotential candidate expressions could be:\n1. A quadratic function: y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2\n2. A cubic function: y = c0*x1^3 + c1*x1^2 + c2*x1 + c3\n3. An exponential function: y = c0*exp(c1*x1)\n\nSince we cannot use constants, we can rewrite these as:\n1. y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2*1\n2. y = c0*x1^3 + c1*x1^2 + c2*x1 + c3*1\n3. y = c0*exp(c1*x1)",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nFrom the provided dataset, it is observed that the output y increases as x1 increases. This suggests the relationship between x1 and y could be polynomial or exponential. The equations provided in the Pareto front have already explored several of these possibilities, using combinations of linear, quadratic, cubic, and exponential functions. \n\nThe equations from the Pareto front indicate that the models with the least mean square error (MSE) are also the most complex. This suggests a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. \n\nLooking at the MSE values, it seems that increasing complexity beyond a certain point doesn't significantly decrease the MSE. For example, the fourth equation in the list has an MSE of 27412.90 and a complexity of 8, while the last equation has an MSE of 26729.51 and a complexity of 17. This slight decrease in MSE might not be worth the substantial increase in complexity.\n\nConsidering these observations, we should aim for equations that are not too complex while still maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy. Therefore, I propose the following three equations:\n\n1. c0*sqrt(x1) + c1/log(x1) - This equation has a complexity of 8, introduces a new function (logarithm), and covers a new combination of functions (square root and logarithm). \n\n2. c0*x1**2 + c1*exp(x1) - This equation has a complexity of 9 and is similar to some of the provided equations but uses a different combination of square and exponential functions.\n\n3. c0*x1**3 + c1*sqrt(x1) - This equation has a complexity of 8 and uses a combination of cubic and square root functions.\n\nThese equations are diverse and span a range of complexities while still using reasonably simple mathematical functions.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nThe dataset has one independent variable (x1) and one dependent variable (y). From the Pareto front analysis, it seems that the data is non-linear and can be best fitted with complex equations involving operations like square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp of the independent variable, along with multiplication and addition/subtraction with constants. The aim is to find 3 new equations that are not SR-similar to the existing equations in the Pareto front, and that minimize both complexity and loss.\n\nLooking at the provided equations, it seems that using a combination of x1 in different power and some unary operations could provide diverse expressions. It's also important to remember to keep the complexity down, so sticking to a maximum of 2 constants and 2-3 operations might be the best approach.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the dataset, it's clear that the relationship between the variables is non-linear and could be polynomial or exponential in nature. There are a few patterns that can be observed:\n\n- There's a general increasing trend in the dependent variable y as the independent variable x1 increases.\n- The rate of increase in y seems to be accelerating as x1 increases, suggesting an exponential or higher order polynomial relationship.\n- There's a slight dip in y for the interval of x1 between 0.2 and 0.6, which may require a more complex model to capture.\n\nFrom the given Pareto front, it's clear that simplicity and accuracy are being traded off. The simplest model (c[0]*x1) has a relatively high MSE of 31135.22, while the most accurate model (c[0]*x1**3+c[1]*x1**2+c[2]*x1+c[3]) is also the most complex, with a complexity of 17.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll propose three new equations that are diverse and aim to balance complexity and accuracy:\n\n1. A logarithmic model: c[0]*log(x1**2) - this model is simple and could capture the non-linear relationship. The square inside the log function may help model the accelerating increase in y.\n2. A model combining linear and exponential terms: c[0]*x1 + c[1]*exp(x1) - this model is slightly more complex but could capture both the general increasing trend and the accelerating increase in y.\n3. A third degree polynomial model: c[0]*x1**3 - this model is simple for a polynomial and could capture the accelerating increase in y.\n\nThe complexity of these models ranges from 5 to 9, which is in the lower half of the complexity range of the models in the Pareto front. The accuracy of these models will need to be evaluated on the data.",
