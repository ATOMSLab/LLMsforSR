Using cube of x1: as x1 increases, cube of x1 will increase significantly, which can model the increase in y.\n  2. Using exponential of x1: similar to cube, exponential of x1 will also increase significantly as x1 increases.\n  3. Using combinations of x1, x1**2, and x1**3: these combinations can model the non-linear relationship between x1 and y.\n\nSuggested Expressions:\n- 'c[0]*x1**3': This equation has a complexity of 5 and models the increase in y as x1 increases. The cube of x1 is used to model the increase in y.\n- 'c[0]*exp(x1**2)': This equation has a complexity of 6. The exponential of x1**2 is used to model the increase in y. The square of x1 is used to increase the rate of increase.\n- 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**3': This equation has a complexity of 9. It combines x1 and x1**3 to model the non-linear relationship between x1 and y.\n\nNote: The complexity and mse are assumed based on the complexity and mse of similar equations in the previous analysis. The actual complexity and mse may vary slightly.",
