  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nFrom the given data, it is observed that as x1 increases, y also increases exponentially. The equation with the least mean squared error (mse) and highest complexity is 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]'. However, the goal is to minimize both complexity and loss. Therefore, new equations will be formed by manipulating the existing ones and introducing unary operators to simplify the equation and reduce mse.\n\nThree new equations can be formed as follows:\n1. Based on the equation 'exp(x1)/c[0]', the mse can be reduced by adding a constant term to the expression, resulting in 'exp(x1)/c[0]+c[1]'. This introduces an additional constant but doesn't increase the complexity significantly. \n   \n2. Building on the equation 'c[0]*x1+c[1]', a unary operator can be applied to x1 to reduce the mse. Since the data seems to follow an exponential trend, 'c[0]*exp(x1)+c[1]' is suggested.\n\n3. The equation 'exp(c[0]*x1)/c[1]' has a relatively low mse and complexity. By incorporating a constant term, we get 'exp(c[0]*x1)/c[1] + c[2]'.\n\nThese suggestions are diverse and have a balance between complexity and mse.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided dataset, it appears that our dependent variable y is increasing exponentially with respect to the independent variable x1. This indicates that an exponential function would likely fit the data well. \n\nGiven that we want to minimize complexity, we should aim for equations with fewer terms and operators. Based on the Pareto front provided, the 'exp(c[0]*x1)/c[1]' equation has a low mean squared error (mse=0.06324867) and a moderate complexity of 6.\n\nHowever, we are asked to suggest diverse equations, so we should consider other forms as well. A logarithmic function might provide a good fit with lower complexity, although the mse might be slightly higher. Similarly, a power function (with x1 raised to a power) might also be a good fit.\n\nWe need to avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions to the ones already provided. Therefore the expressions we suggest should not be equivalent to the ones given after fitting the constants. \n\nIt is also worth noting that x1 starts from -1000 which is a very large negative number.
