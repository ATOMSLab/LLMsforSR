The best-fit equation so far, with the least mean squared error (MSE), is an exponential function, which supports this observation. \n\nSince we are looking for diverse expressions, we need to try different unary operators and binary operators. Also, considering the complexity, we aim to keep the number of terms in the equation minimal. \n\nThe unary operators to consider are square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp. The binary operators to consider are +, -, *, /, and ^. \n\nWe have to be careful not to suggest SR-similar expressions to the ones already suggested. This means we need to think about how constants can be absorbed or consolidated when fitted to the data.\n\nLet's start by considering some modifications to the best performing equation 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)'. We can try replacing the exponentiation with other unary operators or binary operators. However, we have to ensure that the replacement does not result in an SR-similar expression. \n\nNext, we consider the other two equations and try to modify them in a similar way. 'c[0]+c[1]*x1**2' and 'c[0]+c[1]*x1' are both polynomials. We could try replacing the power of 2 in the first equation with other unary operators.

An exponential function with a subtraction operator can capture the initial decrease and later increase of the data. The expression would be c0 - exp(c1*x1).\n3.

A simple polynomial fit: 'c[0]*x1^2 + c[1]*x1'\n2. A logarithmic fit: 'c[0]*log(x1) + c[1]'\n3.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided data and the previous equations, we can see that there is a strong exponential growth trend in the dependent variable y as the independent variable x1 increases. In order to capture this trend, we may consider utilizing more exponential and logarithmic functions. We also need to make sure that the proposed equations are diverse and not SR-similar to the existing ones.\n\nFurthermore, we need to prioritize simplicity along with minimizing loss. Hence, we could consider equations involving simple operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, in addition to the unary operators. The challenge here is to find balance between complexity and accuracy.\n\nWe should also keep in mind the restrictions on the use of operators and constants.\n\nTaking these considerations into account, three new equations can be proposed:\n\n1. c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1^2) - This equation is relatively simple, yet it includes the exponential function which appears to be effective in capturing the trend in the data. The square of x1 may provide a better fit as it can capture the rapid growth.\n\n2. c[0]*log(c[1]*x1) - This equation takes a different approach by using the logarithm function.
