To account for possible deviations from this base model, I will also propose two other models: y = c0 * x1^c1, which allows for power-law behavior, and y = c0 * exp(c1*x1), which generalizes the exponential model.",

From the analysis, 'c[0]*x1' has the least complexity but a high mse of 62.48, while 'c[0]*exp(x1/c[1])' and 'c[0]*c[1]**x1' have relatively low mse (0.06324868) but higher complexity. \n\nLooking at the dataset, the y values seem to increase exponentially with x1. Therefore, equations with exponential functions might fit the data well. \n\nSince the equation 'exp(c[0]*x1)' is already included, we can't suggest SR-similar expressions like 'exp(c[0]/x1)', but we can consider other exponential forms. \n\nWe should also consider logarithmic forms, as they can sometimes fit exponential growth well. \n\nFinally, we should consider forms with division, as they can often fit data with rapid growth.\n\nSuggested equations:\n1. 'c[0]*x1^c[1]': This is a power function, which can often fit exponential growth well. It is not SR-similar to any of the existing equations. \n\n2.
