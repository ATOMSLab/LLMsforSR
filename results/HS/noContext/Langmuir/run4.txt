It is noticeable that an expression with a logarithmic operator has a lesser mean squared error, which suggests that the relationship could be logarithmic or exponential. \n\nConsidering the restrictions and the need for diversity, the new equations should include a variety of operators and functions. It might be useful to include the square root function in one of the expressions, given its lower complexity and the possible fit with the inverse relationship observed in the data.\n\nAlso, we can try a division-based expression and an exponent-based expression.
