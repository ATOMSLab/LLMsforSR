  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the provided dataset and the accuracy and complexity Pareto front, I see that logarithmic and reciprocal forms are performing well in capturing the pattern in the data. This suggests that the relationship between the dependent and independent variable is non-linear and decreases as x1 increases.\n\nThe complexity of the suggested expressions is also lower when the equations involve a single operation on x1, such as taking the logarithm or the reciprocal. Increasing the complexity by adding more operations or constants seems to reduce the mean squared error (mse), but the improvement is not significant enough to justify the added complexity.\n\nGiven these observations, I will propose three new equations that maintain low complexity but try to capture the decreasing relationship in the data through different operations on x1. \n\nRemembering the restrictions, I will avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions and will ensure that the unary operators are limited to square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp, and binary operators are limited to +, -, *, and /.\n\nSuggested equations:\n1. \"c[0]/sqrt(x1)\": This equation maintains low complexity by involving a single operation on x1. The square root function slows the rate of increase of x1, which may better capture the decreasing pattern in the data.\n\n2. \"c[0]*log(sqrt(x1))\": This equation combines two operations on x1 but still maintains relatively low complexity. The log function can capture the decreasing pattern in the data, and the square root function can slow the rate of increase of x1.\n\n3. \"c[0]*(1/exp(x1))\": This equation also maintains low complexity by involving a single operation on x1. The exponential function increases rapidly for larger x1, and taking the reciprocal can capture the decreasing pattern in the data.",
