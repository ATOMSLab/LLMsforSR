Therefore, a possible starting point for our expressions could be y = k/x1, where k is some constant.\n\nWe could also try to include some unary operators into the expressions. Given the restrictions, we could try square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp. However, based on the data, using square, cube or sqrt could result in very large or very small values which may not be useful. So, we will stick with using log and exp.\n\nTherefore, three possible expressions that we could start with are: y = c0/x1, y = c0*log(x1), and y = c0*exp(-x1).\n\nAfter trying these expressions, we can refine them further based on how well they fit the data.",

Specifically, we can combine unary and binary operators in various ways while still keeping the complexity low. We should also strive to lower the error rate. However, we have to be careful not to propose equations that are SR-similar to the ones already in the Pareto front. \n\nFor example, the equation 'c[0]*log(x1)' has a low error rate and complexity, so we should aim to propose equations that are at least as simple and accurate. One way to do this is by incorporating the 'sqrt' unary operator into our equations or using the subtraction binary operator, which hasn't been used yet in the Pareto front.\n\nWe can also try to use the 'exp' unary operator, which also hasn't been used yet, but we should be careful since this operator can significantly increase the complexity of the equation.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the dataset, it seems to be a decreasing function with some form of non-linear relationship between x1 and y. The previous equations suggested have a mix of division, multiplication, and logarithmic operations. There are also some constants involved in the expressions. The mean squared error (MSE) for these equations range from 1.62 to 323.37 with the complexity ranging from 3 to 8.\n\nTo suggest new expressions, we need to consider the restrictions and avoid SR-similar expressions. We can experiment with other unary operations like square, cube, sqrt, and exp. Also, combining binary operators in different ways can help find diverse expressions.\n\nLet's consider the following candidate expressions:\n- 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)': Using the square root operation might capture the non-linear relationship. The complexity is 4.\n- 'c[0]*x1**2': Squaring x1 could capture the non-linear relationship better. The complexity is 3.\n- 'c[0]*exp(-x1)': This includes an exponential decay, which seems to be a characteristic of the data. The complexity is 3.\n\nThese expressions are diverse and they all satisfy the restrictions mentioned. The MSE and complexity of these new expressions will need to be evaluated to know if they are better than the previous suggestions.",

We could try to find an even simpler equation with a similar mse.\n\nAnother potential approach is to introduce a power to x1, such as x1^2 or x1^3. However, this would increase the complexity, so it would need to significantly improve the mse to be worthwhile. \n\nFinally, we might consider using a combination of unary operators, such as log(x1) combined with sqrt(x1) or exp(x1). This could potentially model the data more accurately, but again, the increased complexity would need to be justified.",
