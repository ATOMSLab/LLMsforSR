However, the goal is to find the simplest equation that achieves a balance between complexity and accuracy. From the given equations, there are some patterns to observe. Firstly, the equations with the least error are mainly polynomial equations of the form c[0]*x1**n+c[1]*x1**m+c[2]*x1.\n\nEquations using the exponential and square root functions also achieve relatively low error. This suggests that the relationship between x1 and y is non-linear, and potentially polynomial or exponential. \n\nGiven the restrictions and the goal to minimize complexity and loss, we could suggest the following 3 new equations:\n1. A simple polynomial equation: c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2] - This equation is a modification of the one with the least error. It simplifies the equation by reducing the degree of the polynomial, which reduces the complexity.\n2. An equation with a logarithmic function: c[0]*log(x1)+c[1]*x1 - Logarithms can often model exponential growth or decay, which could fit the data.\n3.
