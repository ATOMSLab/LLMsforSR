The growth in y with respect to x1 seems to be exponential, which indicates the use of multiplication and power operators in the expressions. \n\nWe are asked to predict three expressions, so we can try different combinations of the given operators.\n\n1. For the first expression, we can try x1 cubed multiplied by a constant (c0). This would capture the nonlinearity and rapid increase of the dataset.\n\n2.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the provided Pareto front, the equation with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) is 'c[0]*(x1**2)/sqrt(x1)', but it has a complexity of 8. The simplest equation 'c[0]*exp(x1)' has the highest MSE. It seems that adding complexity lowers the MSE, but we need to find a balance between complexity and accuracy. \n\nThe dataset shows that both the dependent and the independent variable increase, indicating a possible direct relationship between them. We can try the cube of x1 or a combination of square and sqrt to introduce some non-linearity. Also, the log of x1 seems to reduce the MSE significantly while not adding too much complexity, so it can be incorporated. \n\nAvoiding SR-similar expressions, we can propose the following three new expressions:\n1.
