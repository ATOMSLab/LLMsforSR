This would have a complexity of 7, just two more than the linear model, but it might provide a better fit to the data.\n\nSecond, given that the model 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**2' has a relatively low mse of 27820.27773003 with a complexity of 11, it could be beneficial to explore a model that includes the log of x1, but without the quadratic term.

  "LLM Thoughts": "From the Pareto front, it is clear that adding more complexity (additional terms and operators) generally leads to a reduction in the mean squared error (mse). However, the marginal improvement in mse decreases with added complexity.

This suggests that there may be diminishing returns to adding complexity.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the complexity and MSE values provided, it seems that equations with a complexity of 6 and above generally provide a significant reduction in MSE. However, we also need to ensure that our new suggestions are not SR-similar to the ones already provided. \n\nGiven the restrictions, the variable x1 can have the following unary operations applied: square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp. The binary operations we can use are: +, -, *, and /.\n\nThe following are some new equations that are both diverse and not SR-similar to the ones provided:\n\n1. 'c[0] + c[1]*sqrt(x1) + c[2]*log(x1)': This equation combines two unary operations, sqrt and log, with a complexity of 10.\n2. 'c[0] + c[1]*x1**2 + c[2]*log(x1)': This equation combines squaring and log unary operations, with a complexity of 10.\n3. 'c[0] + c[1]*exp(x1) + c[2]*sqrt(x1)': This equation combines exponential and sqrt unary operations, with a complexity of 10.",
