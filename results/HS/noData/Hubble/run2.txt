The other two equations involve logarithmic and exponential functions, both with a complexity of 6 and slightly higher MSEs.\n\nGiven that the dataset is about physical cosmology, where the independent variable (x1) is the proper distance to a galaxy and the dependent variable (y) is its speed of separation, it would be beneficial to suggest equations that could potentially model the relationship between these two variables in the physical world. \n\nSome possibilities could involve using the square root function, the cube function, or combining functions in a different way.\n\nTo ensure diversity and avoid SR-similar expressions, we should steer clear from simply modifying the equations provided on the Pareto front.

The focus should be on generating expressions that are complex enough to capture the non-linear relationship in the data, but also simple enough to adhere to the principle of parsimony.\n\nHere are three suggestions:\n1. A combination of log and cube: This hasn't been used in the Pareto front yet. We can combine them in an additive way, like \"c[0]*log(x1) + c[1]*x1**3\". The complexity of this expression is 8, which is slightly higher than the average complexity in the Pareto front, but it might provide a better fit to the data.\n\n2. A combination of square and sqrt: This combination also hasn't been used yet. We can try \"c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*sqrt(x1)\", with a complexity of 7, which is average for the Pareto front.\n\n3. A combination of exp and log: These two operators are inverses of each other, so using them together in a multiplicative way could capture some interesting patterns in the data. We can try \"c[0]*exp(x1) * log(x1)\", with a complexity of 6, which is slightly below the average complexity in the Pareto front.",

On the other hand, the equations with lower MSE values have higher complexity (6 to 10). Thus, a trade-off must be made between complexity and accuracy.\n\nThe following new equations are proposed, which are different from the previous ones and aim to strike a balance between accuracy and complexity:\n\n1.
