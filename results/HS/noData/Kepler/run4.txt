This law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. \n\nSo, a potential first guess would be y = c0*x1^3. However, as we want the square of the period, it would make sense to use the square root operation on y. So, the first expression becomes y^2 = c0*x1^3, or alternatively, y = sqrt(c0)*x1^(3/2).\n\nWe can also consider some variations on this, such as y = c1*x1^2 + c2*x1^3 or y = c1*x1 + c2*x1^2 + c3*x1^3, which might capture some non-linearity in the data.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided Pareto front, I notice that the mean squared error (MSE) decreases significantly when we use non-linear transformations of the independent variable x1. This suggests that a non-linear relationship exists between the semi-major axis and the period in days.\n\nConsidering the context of the data being about planetary motion in astrophysics, Kepler's third law comes to mind, which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This relationship can be written as y = c*x^(3/2), where y is the period in days and x is the semi-major axis. However, this equation is already in the Pareto front so we need to look for other potential relationships.\n\nOne approach could be to use the square root transformation, cube transformation, and logarithmic transformation on x1 individually and in combination. However, we must avoid creating equations that are 'SR-similar' to the ones in the Pareto front. We also need to keep in mind the complexity of the equation, trying to keep it as simple as possible while still accurately describing the data.\n\nLet's start by using the cube transformation on x1. The simplest equation would be y = c*x^3. This would have a complexity of 5, which is slightly more complex than the simplest equation in the Pareto front (y = c*x), but less complex than the best fitting equation (y = c*x^(3/2)).\n\nNext, we can try the square root transformation on x1. The simplest equation would be y = c*sqrt(x), which would also have a complexity of 5.\n\nFinally, we can try the logarithmic transformation on x1. The simplest equation would be y = c*log(x), which would have a complexity of 4. However, this equation is already in the Pareto front, so we need to add some complexity to this equation to make it distinct. One option would be to square the logarithmic transformation, resulting in y = c*(log(x))^2, which would have a complexity of 7.\n\nThese three equations offer a diverse set of non-linear transformations on x1 and should provide a good balance between accuracy and complexity.",

The unary operators available are square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp. The binary operators available are +, -, *, and /.\n\nThe equations in the Pareto front are mostly using the power operator, and there's a clear pattern that higher powers of x1 (up to 3/2) lead to lower MSE. There's also a pattern of using the sqrt function to further lower the MSE.\n\nConsidering these patterns, we can try to construct new equations that use the sqrt and power operators on x1 in a different way, and also use the cube operator as this hasn't been used in the Pareto front yet.\n\nAlso, it can be noted that the term c[0]*x1**c[1] with lowest MSE has two constants, so we might try expressions with two constants as well.",
