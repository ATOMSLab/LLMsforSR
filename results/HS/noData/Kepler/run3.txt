  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the Pareto front, it appears that the expressions with lower mean squared error (MSE) tend to have higher complexity.

The equation 'c[0]*x1**1.5' has the same MSE but a lower complexity, suggesting it may be a better fit for the data.\n\nConsidering the restrictions and the need for diversity in the suggested equations, we can propose the following new equations:\n\n1. An equation using a logarithm function to transform the independent variable: 'c[0]*log(x1)'\n2. An equation using a square function to transform the independent variable: 'c[0]*x1**2'\n3. An equation using a cube function to transform the independent variable: 'c[0]*x1**3'\n\nThese equations are diverse as they use different unary operators to transform the independent variable, and they are not SR-similar to the existing equations on the Pareto front.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe provided dataset is related to planetary motion with semi-major axis as an independent variable and period in days as the dependent variable. The already suggested equations seem to be having a trade-off between complexity and mean squared error (MSE). \n\nThe simplest equation, c[0]*x1, has the highest MSE of 592043.0850335. The more complex equations, such as c[0]*x1**(1/3) and c[0]*sqrt(x1**3), have significantly lower MSEs, but have higher complexity. \n\nLooking at the data and the nature of the problem (period of rotation of a planet), Kepler's Third Law comes to mind. It states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Translating this into our terminology, it would be something like y^2 = c[0]*x1^3. However, since we're looking for an equation in the form y = ..., we can modify it to y = sqrt(c[0]*x1^3) or y = (c[0]*x1^3)^(1/3). \n\nHowever, these equations are already suggested. We need to suggest new equations that are not SR-similar to the already suggested ones. \n\nAlso, since this is a physics problem, using operators like log and exp might not make much sense unless there's a specific reason to use them (like in case of exponential decay or growth, logarithmic scales, etc.) \n\nSo, we need to come up with equations that use the operators +, -, *, /, square, cube, sqrt in a way that isn't SR-similar to the already suggested ones.",

The goal is to find an equation with the minimum complexity and mse. \n\nGiven that the data is related to planetary motion, the Kepler's third law of planetary motion might be relevant, which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (T^2 \u221d a^3). This suggests that a cube or square root operator might be useful. \n\nThe provided equations already include cube and square root operators. To provide diverse solutions, we should consider using the other unary operators: square, log, and exp. We should also consider using different combinations of binary operators. \n\nThe restrictions limit the choice of unary operators to square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp, and only four binary operators (+, -, *, /) are allowed. \n\nAs there is only a single independent variable, x1, the equations should only include this variable. The equations should also only use the constants c0, c1, etc. \n\nWe need to avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions to the provided ones.
