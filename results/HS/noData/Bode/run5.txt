  "LLM Thoughts": "First, let's analyze the given equations and their complexities and mean square errors (MSEs). The equation 'c[0]*x1**(c[1]/x1)' is a power-law equation where the exponent is inversely proportional to x1. It has a complexity of 7 but its MSE is infinite, suggesting an extremely poor fit.\n\nThe equation 'c[0]*x1**(c[1])' is also a power-law equation where the exponent is constant. It has a lower complexity of 5 and a high MSE of 125122.267325, suggesting a relatively poor fit.\n\nThe equation 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' is an exponential equation with a complexity of 6. It has a very low MSE of 0.06324868, suggesting a good fit.\n\nFrom these, we can see that the exponential equation provides a good fit despite its higher complexity. However, we are tasked with finding equations that minimize both complexity and loss.\n\nTaking into account the restrictions provided, we can come up with the following three equations:\n\n1. 'c[0]*x1': This is a simple linear equation with a complexity of 2. It is the simplest possible equation and will serve as a baseline.\n\n2. 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]': This is a slightly more complex linear equation with a complexity of 4. The addition of a constant term may improve the fit.\n\n3. 'c[0]*x1^c[1]': This is a power-law equation with a complexity of 5. It is similar to one of the given equations but does not have an exponent that depends on x1, which may improve the fit.\n\nThese equations are diverse, with a range of complexities and forms. They should provide a good starting point for further optimization.",

The equations must satisfy several restrictions including the use of five operators: +, -, *, /, ^ and exp, no other complex unary operators, no fitted constants, only include accessible independent variables from data, and not suggest SR-similar expressions. \n\nGiven the current equations, we notice that a variety of operators and complexity levels are already represented. \n\nBased on these constraints, a potential strategy could be to combine different operators in simple ways to generate diverse equations. We should try to avoid SR-similar expressions, which means we should avoid equations that can be simplified to the same form by fitting constants.\n\nEquations to consider:\n1. A simple linear equation with a multiple of the variable and a constant. This has low complexity but might not fit the data well.\n2. An equation combining the power operator and the multiplication operator. This could potentially fit the data better while still having moderate complexity.\n3. An equation combining the exponential, division, and power operators. This has higher complexity but might provide a better fit.",
