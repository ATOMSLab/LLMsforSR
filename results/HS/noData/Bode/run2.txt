The most complex expression has an infinite mean squared error (MSE), implying it's not a good fit at all. The simplest expression (linear) has an MSE of around 33.78, while the expression with a complexity of 6, an exponential equation, has the smallest MSE.\n\nTherefore, we need to devise new expressions that maintain a balance between simplicity and accuracy. Since the data is about a planetary system, Kepler's Third Law could be a potential inspiration for the generation of the new equations.

Polynomials of x1, such as 'c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2'. We already have an equation of this form, but we can try different degrees of the polynomial.\n2. Exponential functions of x1, such as 'c0*exp(c1*x1)' or 'c0*exp(-c1*x1)'. We already have equations of this form, but we can try mixing the exponential with other forms.\n3. Rational functions of x1, such as 'c0/(c1*x1 + c2)'. This is a new type of equation that we haven't tried yet.\n\nWe should avoid equations that are similar to the ones we already have. For example, 'c0*x1/(c1^x1)' and 'c0*exp(-c1*x1)' are similar because they both involve an exponential decay.
