  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nTo generate new expressions, let's build from the simplest ones provided and then gradually increase complexity. The provided equations suggest that exponentiation and the exponential function are particularly effective in this context, likely because the data represents a planetary system and such systems often exhibit exponential or power-law behavior. \n\n1. The simplest provided equation is 'c[0]*x1^c[1]'. A small modification could be to add another term to this equation that includes x1 without exponentiation, such as 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1^c[2]'. This has a complexity of 7, which increases the complexity of the equation by 2 compared to the simplest provided equation.\n\n2. The equation 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' also performs well. A small modification could be to add another term that includes the exponential of a linear function of x1, such as 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1) + c[2]*exp(c[3]*x1 + c[4])'. This has a complexity of 9, which is a moderate increase in complexity.\n\n3. To generate a more complex equation, we could combine the modifications made in the first two steps, resulting in the equation 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1^c[2] + c[3]*exp(c[4]*x1) + c[5]*exp(c[6]*x1 + c[7])'.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the existing equations, it can be seen that the model has already tried various combinations of the operators and variables. It has used power, division, addition, multiplication, and exponentiation with various complexities. However, there are still some combinations that haven't been tested. \n\nOne pattern that can be seen in the data is that the model seems to perform better with equations that use exponentiation. This could be due to the nature of the data, which is about planetary systems where certain properties might have exponential relationships.\n\nAlso, some equations have very high complexity but not necessarily low mean squared error (MSE). This suggests that adding more terms or increasing the complexity of the equation does not always improve the accuracy. Therefore, it might be beneficial to look for simpler equations as well.\n\nBased on these observations, we can propose some new equations that have not been explored before, which might provide a good balance between accuracy and complexity.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the dataset, there seems to be a trend where the complexity of the equation increases as the mean squared error (MSE) decreases. This implies that more complex equations can better capture the underlying patterns in the data. \n\nThe dataset contains a mix of polynomial, exponential, and rational (division) functions. The best performing functions in terms of MSE are those that combine these different types. For example, the equation with the lowest MSE incorporates a polynomial term (x1^2), an exponential term (exp(c3*x1)), and a linear term (c0*x1).\n\nIn terms of complexity, the simplest equations are those that only incorporate one type of function. For instance, the equation with the lowest complexity is a simple polynomial (x1^c1), whereas the most complex equation combines polynomial and exponential functions.\n\nGiven these observations, the following three equations are suggested:\n\n1. A combination of a polynomial and exponential function: c0*x1^2 + c1*exp(c2*x1)\n2. A rational function: c0*x1 / (c1 + x1)\n3. An exponential function: c0*exp(c1*x1^2)\n\nThese suggestions attempt to strike a balance between complexity and accuracy, and provide diversity in terms of the types of functions used.",
