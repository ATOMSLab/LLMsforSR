  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLet's start by forming a basic understanding of the data. The semi-major axis of a planet in a planetary system is likely to increase with the planet index (x1), as planets farther from the star are likely to have larger orbits. Therefore, we can expect some form of positive relationship between x1 and y.\n\nConsidering the restrictions on the expressions, we are limited to simple mathematical operations. No non-linear functions like trigonometric, logarithmic, or higher-order polynomial functions are allowed. However, we can still form complex non-linear relationships by combining the operations creatively. Given the nature of the data, we are likely to need some form of exponential or power-law relationship. \n\nSo, given the above restrictions and insights, let's try to form three possible expressions that could describe the data. Ideally, we'd want to start simple and gradually increase the complexity of the expressions.\n\nExpression 1: A simple linear relationship. Although it's unlikely to fit the data well, it's a good starting point. We can form a simple linear relationship using the \"+\" and \"*\" operators. \n\nExpression 2: A simple power-law relationship. This could potentially fit the data better, as it allows for a non-linear relationship between x1 and y. We can form this relationship using the \"^\" operator.\n\nExpression 3: A more complex expression that combines multiple operations. This could potentially fit the data even better, as it allows for more complex non-linear relationships between x1 and y. We can form this relationship by creatively combining the \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\", \"^\", and \"exp\" operators.",

For example, we should not use expressions where constants can be consolidated into one fitted constant or where the sign of a constant can be absorbed after fitting.\n\nLet's try to create new expressions:\n\n1. 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]/x1' - This equation is a modification of the third equation from the given set. We add a term 'c[2]/x1' to increase complexity a bit while potentially improving the fit by introducing a term that decreases with increasing x1.\n\n2.

  "LLM Thoughts": "From the given Pareto front, we can observe that the most complex function provides poor results (infinite mean square error), while the least complex functions provide relatively good results. This suggests that a simpler function may be better suited to this dataset. Additionally, the current Pareto front contains functions using a mix of operators, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and the exponential function. This gives us a good range of operators to choose from when constructing new functions.\n\nFor the new equations, we will aim to minimize both the complexity and the loss. We'll construct function forms that are different from the ones already in the Pareto front to provide a diverse set of options.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Given the constraints and the need for diversity, the following equations are suggested:\n\n- A linear equation: c[0] + c[1]*x1\n- A quadratic equation without a linear term: c[0] + c[1]*x1^2\n- An exponential equation without a linear term: c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)\n\nThese equations are diverse and have different properties that may align with the dataset. The linear equation assumes a constant rate of change, the quadratic equation allows for a changing rate of change, and the exponential equation assumes an increasingly rapid rate of change. \n\nKeep in mind that the provided dataset has only one independent variable (x1), so the suggested equations are univariate. Also, they are not SR-similar to the previously suggested ones.",
