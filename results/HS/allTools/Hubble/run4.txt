  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the data, it seems to be increasing as x1 increases. This indicates that the separation speed of the galaxy increases with distance. This aligns with the Hubble's law in cosmology which states that the velocity of galaxies moving away from the observer is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. The formula for Hubble's law is V = H0 * D where V is the velocity, H0 is the Hubble constant, and D is the distance. \n\nThe problem does not allow fitting constants, so we can use c0 for the Hubble constant. This gives us our first equation as y = c0 * x1.\n\nGiven the non-linear nature of the data, other potential fits could include squared and cubed terms of x1. These will give us additional equations as y = c1 * x1^2 and y = c2 * x1^3.",

Some equations contain binary operations, unary operations, or both. The independent variable 'x1' is used in all equations and it's often manipulated under unary operations of square, cube, or square root. \n\nThe binary operations on 'x1' are mostly multiplication, with one instance of addition. To increase diversity, we need to explore the use of subtraction and division, along with more diverse use of unary operators. \n\nConsidering the need to minimize complexity, we can limit the use of multiple unary operations on 'x1'.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the dataset, the data seems to have a non-linear relationship. The dependent variable (y) is increasing as the independent variable (x1) increases. However, the rate of increase is not constant, suggesting a non-linear relationship.\n\nGiven this, we are asked to suggest three new equations that minimize both complexity and loss. We also need to ensure that these equations are diverse and not SR-similar to the ones already in the Pareto front.\n\nTo achieve this, we can consider various combinations of the allowed binary and unary operators. We can also incorporate the square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp functions in our equations to capture the non-linearity in the data. \n\nSince the data is related to cosmology and involves distance and speed, we can also consider incorporating physical principles in our equations. For example, we can include terms that represent acceleration (second derivative of distance) or velocity (first derivative of distance).\n\nKeeping these considerations in mind, here are three potential equations for analysis:\n\n1. c[0]*x1^3: This equation captures the cubic relationship between distance and speed. The complexity is low because it only involves one operator and one variable.\n\n2. c[0]*sqrt(x1)/x1: This equation captures the relationship between speed and the square root of distance divided by distance. The complexity is moderate because it involves two operators and one variable.\n\n3. c[0]*log(x1): This equation captures the logarithmic relationship between distance and speed. The complexity is low because it only involves one operator and one variable.\n\nNone of these equations are SR-similar to the ones previously suggested.
