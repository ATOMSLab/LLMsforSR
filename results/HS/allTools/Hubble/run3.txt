However, we're tasked with suggesting three new equations that minimize both complexity and loss, and that aren't SR-similar to the existing ones. \n\nThe dataset presents a pattern which seems to be in line with the Hubble's law in cosmology, stating that the speed of separation of galaxies is directly proportional to their distance. This is reflected in the best fit 'c[0]*x1'. However, considering the non-linear nature of the universe, we might need to account for some non-linearity in our model. \n\nWe can exploit the unary operators to introduce some non-linearity. However, we must ensure we don't end up suggesting SR-similar expressions. This can be achieved by strategically placing the unary operators in the equations. \n\nAlso, we can play around with the binary operators to introduce more complexity in the model. But the aim should be to keep the complexity as low as possible.\n\nThe following three equations might be good candidates:\n\n1. c[0]*log(x1**2)\n2. c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*x1**2\n3. c[0]*x1**3 - c[1]*x1",
