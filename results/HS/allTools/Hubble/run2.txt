This could suggest that a function involving multiplication or exponentiation might be a good fit. \n\nGiven the context of the data, it suggests a cosmological relation, reminiscent of Hubble's law, which states that the velocity of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This law is often expressed as v = H0 * d, where v is the velocity (which is the dependent variable y in our case), H0 is the Hubble constant (which could be represented by c0 in our expressions), and d is the distance (which is the independent variable x1 in our case). \n\nFirst, I will try the simple linear equation y = c0 * x1, to see if it fits the data appropriately. \n\nSecond, I will try a slightly more complex equation, y = c0 * x1^2, to see if a quadratic relationship might better fit the data. \n\nThird, I will also try an exponential relationship, y = c0 * exp(x1), to see if this provides a better fit to the data.",

Here are some diverse equations that could fit the data well:\n\n1. 'c0 * log(x1)' : This is a simple equation with low complexity. The logarithm can capture exponential growth.\n2.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the data and the provided equations, the key seems to be finding a balance between complexity and mean squared error (mse). The equation with the lowest complexity has a higher mse, and as complexity increases, mse generally decreases. However, there are some exceptions, such as 'c[0]*(x1**3)-c[1]*sqrt(x1)' which has a higher complexity but higher mse than 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)'. This suggests there may be other, simpler equations that could provide a lower mse.\n\nTaking into account the restrictions and the physical cosmology context of the data, we need to find equations that describe the relationship between the speed of separation of a galaxy (y) and its proper distance (x1). Considering the physical implications, it makes sense that faster speed of separation could be associated with greater distance. This suggests equations where y increases as x1 increases might fit the data well.\n\nGiven the restrictions, the equations we suggest should involve the operators +, -, *, /, square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp, but not necessarily all of them. The equations should also only use the independent variable x1 and constants represented by c0, c1, etc.\n\nTo generate diverse equations, we can consider combinations of different operators. For example, a combination of multiplication and a unary operator (such as square or cube), or a combination of addition/subtraction and a unary operator. We should also aim to keep the complexity low to avoid overfitting and improve interpretability.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following three expressions are suggested:\n\n1. 'c[0]*x1**2/c[1]': This equation is a variation of the quadratic equation, with a division to reduce the effect of the square term. This could potentially fit the data well if there is a relationship between the square of the distance and the speed of separation.\n\n2. 'c[0]*log(x1) + c[0]*x1': This equation combines a logarithmic term and a linear term, which could capture both rapid initial increases in speed of separation with small increases in distance, and slower increases with larger distances.\n\n3. 'c[0]/(x1**2)': This equation uses the inverse square law, which is common in physics. It could fit the data well if the speed of separation decreases as the square of the distance increases.",
