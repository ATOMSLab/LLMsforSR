  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided data, we can see that as pressure (x1) increases, loading (y) decreases. This suggests the relationship might be inversely proportional, which means the equation could be of the form y = a/x1. \n\nAlso, the decrease from data point to data point seems to be progressively smaller. This suggests that there might be a logarithmic relationship between the pressure and loading. Thus, considering an equation of the form y = log(x1) could be useful.\n\nFinally, the decrease is not strictly linear, which suggests some kind of polynomial relationship. A polynomial of degree 2 could be a good fit, so we might want to consider an equation of the form y = x1^2.",

The data seems to be decreasing, which matches the behavior of an inverse function. An exponential relationship doesn't seem likely based on these results, and a linear relationship has not been explored yet. \n\nGiven the restrictions for the new suggestions, we should avoid suggesting equations that are similar to the ones already given (any equation with a log, inverse, or a square). Therefore, we can try to explore the cubic relationship, sqrt relationship, and linear relationship by suggesting equations such as 'c[0]*x1**3', 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)', and 'c[0]*x1'.
