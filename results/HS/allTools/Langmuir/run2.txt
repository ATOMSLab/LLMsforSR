The expressions with these unary operators have a lower MSE compared to the expression with no unary operator applied on x1. This indicates that the application of unary operators is helping to better fit the model to the data.\n\nTo suggest new expressions, we can try to apply different unary operators or combinations of them. We should also ensure that the new expressions are not SR-similar to the ones already suggested to avoid redundancy.\n\nTaking into account the restrictions on the binary and unary operators that can be used, the following expressions could be suggested:\n\n1. c[0] - exp(c[1]*x1): This expression applies the exponential function on x1. It is different from the ones already suggested and could potentially fit the data better.\n\n2. c[0] - (c[1]/x1): This expression uses division instead of multiplication.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the provided dataset and previous equations, it appears that the data is inversely related to x1 in some way, with a decreasing trend as x1 increases. This is reflected in the previous equations where x1 is either squared or in the denominator. Also, the log(x1) equation provided a good fit with low MSE, suggesting logarithmic behaviour. Taking these observations into account, I will propose three new equations that follow the same inverse or logarithmic trend but with varied complexity:\n\n1. A combination of a simple linear model with a logarithmic model: c0 + c1/log(x1)\n2. A square root model: c0 - c1*sqrt(x1)\n3. An exponential model: c0 - c1*exp(-x1)\n\nRemember, a good model is not only about low MSE but also about simplicity (low complexity). The exponential model is a bit more complex but might provide a good fit. The square root model is simpler and might also provide an interesting fit. The first model combines linear and logarithmic behaviour and has a medium complexity.",

To provide diverse suggestions, I will consider using the unary operators that haven't been used yet: cube and sqrt.\n\n1. The first equation I suggest involves the cube operator. As the cube of a positive number is always positive, I will use subtraction to match the negative correlation in the dataset. This gives the equation: 'c[0] - c[1]*x1**3'.\n\n2. The second equation I suggest involves the sqrt operator. Since the sqrt of a positive number is also positive, I will again use subtraction. This gives: 'c[0] - c[1]*sqrt(x1)'.\n\n3. For the third equation, I will use the log operator, but in a slightly different way to the existing equation.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nThe provided dataset represents a relationship between nitrogen adsorption (loading) and pressure (x1). The values for loading decrease as pressure increases, indicating a potentially inverse or logarithmic relationship.\n\nConsidering the complexity and mean squared error (MSE) of the provided equations, the best equation currently is 'c[0]+c[1]*log(x1)', with a complexity of 6 and MSE of 0.29885775. However, we need to suggest three diverse equations that minimize both complexity and loss.\n\nThe equations should be distinct from each other and from the ones already provided to ensure diversity. Considering the restrictions on binary and unary operators, we can use combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp operations.\n\nFirst, looking at the pattern of data, an inverse relation can be a good fit. Hence, 'c[0]/x1' can be a starting point. This equation is simple and different from the ones already provided.\n\nSecond, to incorporate logarithmic characteristics, the equation 'c[0]*log(c[1]/x1)' could be proposed. This equation is different from the 'c[0]*log(x1)' one in the Pareto front.\n\nThird, to include the exponential function, we can suggest the equation 'c[0]*exp(-x1/c[1])'. This equation also represents a decreasing trend with increasing x1, and is different from the 'c[0]*exp(-c[1]/x1)' in the Pareto front.\n\nNote: We aim to minimize complexity, hence we avoid using cube and square root operators which may not significantly improve the fit but will increase complexity.",
