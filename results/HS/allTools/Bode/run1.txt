This could suggest an exponential relationship between x1 and y. The first expression I'd consider would hence be of the form y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1).\n\nHowever, due to the presence of a zero and negative value in x, an exponential function might not be the best fit. We could instead look at a power-based relationship, leading to the second expression of the form y = c0 * x1 ^ c1. \n\nFinally, since the increase in y isn't perfectly exponential, there might be a logarithmic component involved as well.

To generate diverse new equations, other operators and functions can be considered, such as logarithmic, square, and cube. However, the exponential nature of the data suggests that these may not be as fitting. \n\nMoreover, the complexity of the models on the Pareto front ranges from 3 to 9, with the mean squared error (MSE) decreasing as the complexity increases. This indicates that more complex models are better at capturing the underlying patterns in the data, although this comes at the cost of increased complexity.\n\nGiven the constraints specified, it should be noted that the expressions should be unique and not similar to the existing ones to avoid redundancy.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the dataset, it appears that the dependent variable (y) increases exponentially as the independent variable (x1) increases. The equations provided in the Pareto front also show that models with exponential terms have lower mean squared error (MSE) values, indicating better fits to the data.\n\nThe lowest complexity model with an exponential term is 'exp(c[0]*x1)', with a complexity of 4 and a MSE of 1.32407086. However, this model might be too simple to capture the data pattern effectively, especially for larger values of x1.

In light of this, I will suggest new models that use different operators and functions to offer more diversity.\n\nOne potential model could use a cube function, as it can also capture the increasing trend in the data. Another model could use a log function, which could help to capture the possible logarithmic relationship between y and x1. Finally, a model that combines different functions might provide a more accurate and complex representation of the data.\n\nWhen considering the restrictions on complexity and operators, I suggest the following three models:\n\n1. c[0]*x1**3: This model uses the cube function and has a complexity of 5.\n2. c[0]*log(x1+c[1]): This model uses the log function and has a complexity of 7.\n3. c[0]*x1*exp(c[1]*x1): This model combines multiplication and exponential functions and has a complexity of 7.",
