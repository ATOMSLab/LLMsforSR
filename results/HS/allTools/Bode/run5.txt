This makes sense, as the semi-major axis distances in a planetary system often follow a specific distribution pattern often referred to as a 'Titius-Bode' law.\n\nGiven the restrictions, we should try to stick with combinations of operators which will yield an exponential growth pattern while also maintaining a lower complexity.
