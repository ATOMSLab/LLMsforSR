Hence, an exponential function would be a good fit for this data. \n\nHowever, we are limited to only five unary operations that do not include exponentiation directly. But we can use the exp function which is the equivalent of e^x. \n\nTo maintain simplicity, I will first try to fit the data to a function of the form y = exp(c0*x1). If this does not provide a good fit, I'll try a more complex form such as y = exp(c0*x1 + c1) or y = exp(c0*x1^c1). \n\nIf none of these provide a good fit, I might need to consider a function involving multiple terms, such as y = c0*x1 + exp(c1*x2) or y = c0*x1^c1 + c2*x2^c3, where x2 is another transformation of the original variable x1.",
