This gives us a hint that an expression of the form c[0]*x1**1.5 might represent the data well.\n\nHowever, since the given equation is c[0]*x1**(3/2) and we are asked for diverse equations, we need to explore other possibilities for the relationship between the period and the semi-major axis, keeping in mind that the relationship is likely non-linear and increases as x1 increases.\n\nOne possibility is a simple power relationship with a different exponent, such as x1**2 or x1**3. Another possibility is to combine multiple power relationships, such as x1**2 + x1**3.\n\nFinally, since the data is likely to be noisy, a logarithmic or exponential transformation might help to stabilize the variance and make the relationship more linear. An expression of the form exp(c[0]*x1) or log(c[0]*x1) might therefore be useful.",

A square root function of x1, as we haven't tried this yet. Although it might increase the complexity, it can potentially decrease the MSE.\n2. A cubic function of x1, as the cubic term has shown to decrease the MSE in the equation 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1**3' but it's combined with the square term.
