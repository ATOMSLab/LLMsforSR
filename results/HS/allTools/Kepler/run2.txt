This is suggested by the fact that as x1 increases, y increases exponentially. A common power law in planetary motion is Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. So, a good starting point would be y = c0*x1^c1.\n\nFor additional expressions, possible variations could be y = c0*x1^c1 + c2, y = c0*(x1^c1 + c2), or y = c0*(x1^c1 - c2).",

This is represented by the formula T^2 = k*r^3, where T is the period, r is the semi-major axis and k is a constant.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the Pareto front:\n- The equation with the least complexity is 'c[0]*exp(x1)', but it has a very high mean squared error (MSE).\n- The equation with the least MSE is 'c[0]*(x1**c[1]+c[2])', but it has a relatively high complexity.\n- Therefore, we need to find a balance between the two.\n\nConsidering the nature of the data and the restrictions, I would suggest the following equations:\n1. c[0]*x1**2: This equation is simpler than the least complex one in the Pareto front and represents Kepler's Third Law, which should fit the data well.\n2. c[0]*x1**3: This equation is a bit more complex but should also fit the data well as it represents the cube of the semi-major axis, in line with Kepler's Third Law.\n3. c[0]*(x1**2 + x1): This equation introduces a bit more complexity by adding an extra term, but might provide a better fit to the data.\n\nRemember, the equations should be diverse and avoid SR-similarity.",

The 'c[0]*exp(x1)' expression has the highest MSE and lowest complexity, suggesting it is not a good fit. The 'c[0]*(x1**c[1]+c[2])' expression, on the other hand, has a lower MSE and higher complexity, indicating it is a better fit but its complexity is high.\n\nWe must propose new expressions that are not SR-similar to the existing ones.

However, there is a significant drop in MSE between complexity 8 and 7, indicating that a complexity of 7 or lower could provide a good balance between accuracy and simplicity.\n\nOne possible approach to suggesting new equations would be to modify the existing equations in the Pareto front. For example, the equation with the lowest MSE and complexity of 7 is \"c[0]*(x1**c[1]+c[2])\". This equation could be modified by replacing the binary operator or changing the unary operator applied to x1.\n\nAnother approach could be to combine elements of the existing equations.
