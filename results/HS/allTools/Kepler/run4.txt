However, there are still some possible equations that could be considered.\n\nConsidering the constraints, we should aim to use the simplest unary operators first and then move to more complex ones if needed. Also, we need to make sure not to suggest SR-similar expressions to those already listed in the Pareto front.\n\nThe equations to consider would then be:\n\n1. 'c[0]*x1': This is a linear equation, which is a simplification of 'c[0]*x1**c[1]'. It may not fit the data well, but it's worth trying due to its simplicity.\n\n2. 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)': This is somewhat more complex than the linear equation, but still simpler than the equations in the Pareto front. It might provide a better fit to the data.\n\n3. 'c[0]*log(x1)': This is more complex, but logarithmic functions can sometimes fit data with exponential trends quite well.",
