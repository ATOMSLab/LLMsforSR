Given the nature of the data and the requirement for low complexity and low loss, we need to consider the physical laws that govern the movement of galaxies. The Hubble's law suggests that the speed of separation is proportional to the distance. This is already reflected in the existing equations. 

However, we can try to add more diversity by considering the influence of other factors. For instance, the gravitational pull can be inversely proportional to the square of the distance. This can be reflected in an equation with a division operator. 

We can also try to incorporate a log function which can model the diminishing effect of distance on the speed of separation. The cube function can model the exponential increase in speed with distance. 

Taking into account the restrictions and the need for diversity, we can propose the following equations:

1. 'c[0]/x1': This equation models the inverse relationship between distance and speed. It has a complexity of 3, which is relatively low.

2. 'c[0]*log(x1)': This equation models the logarithmic relationship between distance and speed. It has a complexity of 4, which is relatively higher but still manag...

      ...The dataset seems to be following a pattern that might be described by a linear, exponential, or logarithmic function. However, considering the context of the dataset, it's likely to follow Hubble's law, which is a linear relationship between the speed of separation and distance of a galaxy. 

Given the constraints, I would propose the following three expressions:

1. A linear expression: y = c0 * x1
2. An exponential expression: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)
3. A logarithmic expression: y = c0 + c1 * log(x1)...

Looking at the dataset, I observe a linear relationship between the variables. This is consistent with Hubble's law in cosmology which states that the speed of separation (v) of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance (d) from the observer. Therefore, the first expression could be a simple linear equation, y = c0*x1.

However, as the dataset represents real-world observations, there might be some non-linearities due to factors such as measurement errors, cosmic variance, and the effects of dark matter and dark energy. To account for these, I can also try a quadratic equation, y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1, and a logarithmic equation, y = c0*log(x1)....

Looking at the provided Pareto front, the simplest equation has a complexity of 3 with a mean square error (MSE) of 31135.22243454, while the most complex has a complexity of 9 with a lower MSE of 29452.94200293. This highlights a trade-off between complexity and accuracy. 

Since the data is about physical cosmology, and we're looking at proper distance to a galaxy (x1) and its speed of separation (y), we may want to consider equations that align with the physics knowledge we know, especially Hubble's law.

To suggest new equations, I need to ensure they are not SR-similar to the existing ones and they respect the restrictions in terms of operators and variables. I'll consider a diverse set of unary operators (sqrt, log, and exp) and binary operators (+, -, *, /) to create unique equations....

Looking at the given equations, it seems that the underlying model is a power-law relationship, which is common in physical cosmology. The complexity increases with the number of operations and constants involved.

Since the data is about physical cosmology, the Hubble's law, which states that the speed of a galaxy is proportional to its distance from the observer, might be a good starting point. This is represented by the equation "c[0]*x1", which is already in the list with a complexity of 3 and MSE of 31135.22243454.

I will also consider the inverse relation (i.e., "c[0]/x1") and logarithmic relation (i.e., "c[0]*log(x1)") as they are simple and could capture possible non-linearities in the data. 

Another type of equation not present in the list is a quadratic one, represented by "c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]". Although this has a somewhat higher complexity, it may capture a parabolic trend in the data, if present. 

Also, equations involving the exponential ("c[0]*exp(x1)") and cube root ("c[0]*cbrt(x1)") functions can be considered as they may capture potential exponential growth or sub-linear trends in the data, respectively. 

Finally, an equation involving both square root and addition operations, represented by "c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*x1", could be co...

Given the data is about physical cosmology and the Hubble's law (v = H0 * D), where D is the proper distance to a galaxy and v is its speed of separation, we can derive equations based on this law. 

The first equation can be a simple linear equation that directly reflects Hubble's law.

The second equation can be a manipulation of the first equation, taking the square of x1.

The third equation can be a further extension of the second equation, taking the cube of x1.

All equations will involve multiplication of x1 with a constant (c0, c1, c2) to account for the Hubble constant (H0) in the original Hubble's law....

Based on the provided Pareto front, we need to suggest equations that are not SR-similar to the existing ones, have low complexity, and possibly offer good fit to the data. Even though we cannot directly determine the accuracy of the new suggestions without fitting them to the data, we can propose formulas that are likely to capture the non-linear relationship in cosmological data.

A common approach in physical cosmology to relate distance and speed is Hubble's law, which proposes a linear relationship. However, more accurate models often involve logarithmic or exponential terms. The provided Pareto front already contains expressions involving linear, quadratic, square root, and logarithmic terms. Therefore, we can explore combinations that are not SR-similar to these.

Let's propose some equations:

1. "c[0]*log(x1**2)": The complexity of this equation is 6, the same as the first equation in Pareto front, but it's not SR-similar to any of the existing ones. It introduces a logarithm of a square, which might be able to capture some complex non-linearities.

2. "c[0]*exp(-x1)": This equation has a complexity of 5, and introduces an exponential term. It's not SR-similar to any existing equation in the Pareto front. The negative exponent might be able to capture the fact that speed of separation decreases as the distance increases.

3. "c[0]*x1/(log(x1)+1)": This equation has a complexity of 7, which is higher than the minimum in the Pareto f...
