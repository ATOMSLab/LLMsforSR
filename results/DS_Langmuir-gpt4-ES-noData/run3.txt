Physical adsorption often follows the rules of Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms.\n\nHowever, due to the limitations on the expression, we cannot use exponential or logarithmic functions, which are common in these isotherm models. Therefore, the best possible approach would be to use polynomial or rational functions to approximate the relationship.\n\nThree possible forms of such equations might be:\n- A linear relationship (y = c0 * x1 + c1)\n- A quadratic relationship (y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2)\n- A rational relationship (y = (c0 * x1 + c1) / (c2 * x1 + c3))\n\nThese forms were chosen because they are simple, yet can capture a wide range of possible relationships.",
