This is similar to fitting a polynomial, but the coefficients aren't necessarily integers.\n\nLet's start simple, with a linear model. The dependent variable, y, is loading. The independent variable, x, is pressure. The simplest linear model is y = c0 + c1*x1. \n\nGiven the nature of adsorption, the loading (y) might increase with pressure (x1) at a decreasing rate. This suggests a quadratic model might be a better fit, such as y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2.\n\nHowever, the process could also be influenced by inverse pressure effects. So, an inverse model, like y = c0 + c1/x1, might also be a good fit.",

The goal is to suggest equations that minimize complexity and loss and are diverse from the provided list.\n\nFrom the Pareto front, the current best equation in terms of complexity and MSE seems to be '(c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2])/(c[3]+x1)', with a complexity of 15 and MSE of 0.00108275.\n\nWe need to suggest equations that are not SR-similar to the ones provided. This means we need to avoid equations that are equivalent after fitting the constants to data. For example, 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2]' is SR-similar to 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1' because c2 can be absorbed into the other constants after fitting the data.\n\nTaking these points into account, we can suggest the following three equations:\n\n1. 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]/x1'\n2. 'c[0] + c[1]*x1 - c[2]/x1'\n3. '(c[0]*x1 - c[1])/(c[2]*x1 + c[3])'\n\nThese equations are diverse and not SR-similar to the ones provided. They also follow the restrictions and use only the basic mathematical operators and the independent variable x1. The complexity of these equations is also relatively low, which should help minimize the MSE.",

The simplest equations have significantly higher mse. Therefore, there's a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.\n\nWe need to suggest new expressions that minimize both complexity and mse. Since the dataset is about isobutane adsorbing onto silicalite at constant temperature, the relationship between pressure (x1) and loading (y) is likely to be non-linear.\n\nThe first expression I suggest is a simple linear equation with an added constant: c[0]*x1 + c[1]. Although this is similar to one of the existing equations, the constants are different, so this equation is not SR-similar.\n\nThe second expression I suggest is a quadratic equation: c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*x1 + c[2]. This equation might be able to capture non-linear relationships between pressure and loading.\n\nThe third expression I suggest is a rational function: (c[0]*x1 + c[1]) / (c[2]*x1 + c[3]). This equation is similar to the one with the lowest mse on the Pareto front, but with different constants.\n\nThese three equations have different forms and complexities, and they all have the potential to capture the relationship between pressure and loading in this dataset.",

The goal here is to suggest three new equations that minimize both complexity and MSE. We need to maintain diversity and avoid redundancy.\n\nHere are a few observations:\n1. The simplest equation has a complexity of 3 and a high MSE, indicating a poor fit.\n2. The most complex equation has a complexity of 23 and a low MSE, indicating a better fit but at a high complexity cost.\n3. The equations with the lowest MSEs and relatively low complexities are mostly ratios of polynomials with varying degrees.\n\nGiven these observations and the constraints provided, I will come up with three new equations. The first one will be a simple linear function to see if a simpler model can achieve a reasonable MSE. The second one will be a ratio of two polynomials of different degrees to see if a balance between complexity and MSE can be achieved. The third one will be a more complex ratio of polynomials to see if a lower MSE can be achieved at the cost of higher complexity.",
