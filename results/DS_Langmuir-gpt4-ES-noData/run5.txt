Linear equation with a division - This will be a simple modification of the suggested linear equation to add diversity.\n2. Quadratic equation without constant term - This will be a less complex version of the quadratic equation with similar mse.\n3.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided equations, I can see that the lower complexity equations tend to have higher MSEs, while the higher complexity equations have lower MSEs. This is expected as more complex equations are better able to capture the nuances in the data, leading to a smaller error. \n\nHowever, we are interested in finding equations that strike a balance between complexity and accuracy. Observing the provided equations, it's clear that the equations often include terms that are a power of x1, a term divided by x1, or both. I'll generate some new equations following these patterns, while avoiding SR-similar expressions. \n\nTo do this, I'll construct equations that incorporate different combinations of these elements, ensuring that the complexity is not too high (to avoid overfitting) and that the equation is not SR-similar to the ones already provided. I'll also ensure that the equations satisfy the provided restrictions.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nGiven the constraints of the problem, we need to generate three new expressions that are not SR-similar to the ones already suggested. We should aim to keep the complexity low while capturing the non-linear relationship. \n\nA simple linear expression 'c[0]*x1' has already been tried, so we need to introduce some non-linearity, but without using complex unary operators. \n\nOne way of doing this is to combine the variables in different ways using the allowed operators. We can experiment with different combinations of multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. \n\nLooking at the current Pareto front, all suggested expressions are either additive or multiplicative, but none of them uses a combination of division and subtraction. This might be an interesting space to explore.\n\nThree new equations that could capture the non-linear relationship with relatively low complexity could be:\n1. 'c[0]*x1 - c[1]/x1' : This expression combines multiplication, subtraction, and division.\n2. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1] - x1)' : This expression combines multiplication and division with the subtraction operator.\n3. 'c[0]/(x1 - c[1]) + c[2]*x1' : This expression combines all four operators.
