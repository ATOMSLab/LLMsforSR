From the information provided, we can infer that the process of adsorption usually follows certain mathematical models such as the Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms. However, given the constraints on the types of operators we can use, we cannot directly apply these models. 

Instead, we need to look for simpler mathematical relationships. The simplest relationship could be a linear one, y = c0*x1 + c1. However, adsorption processes are typically non-linear. A slightly more complex model could be a quadratic equation, y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2. 

Considering that the pressure/loading relationship might not be perfectly quadratic, a cubic relationship might be an alternate model for this data, y = c0*x1^3 + c1*x1^2 + c2*x1 + c3. 

Finally, a rational function might be a good fit as well, y = (c0*x1 + c1) / (c2*x1 + c3), this type of function can model a variety of relationships, including those that asymptotically approach a limit as x1 increases....

Given that the dataset is about isobutane adsorbing onto silicalite at constant temperature, it is likely that the relationship follows the principles of adsorption isotherms. Physical adsorption often follows the rules of Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms.

However, due to the limitations on the expression, we cannot use exponential or logarithmic functions, which are common in these isotherm models. Therefore, the best possible approach would be to use polynomial or rational functions to approximate the relationship.

Three possible forms of such equations might be:
- A linear relationship (y = c0 * x1 + c1)
- A quadratic relationship (y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2)
- A rational relationship (y = (c0 * x1 + c1) / (c2 * x1 + c3))

These forms were chosen because they are simple, yet can capture a wide range of possible relationships....
