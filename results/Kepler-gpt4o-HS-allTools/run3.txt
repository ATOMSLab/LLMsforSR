  \n\nThe dataset represents a planetary system where the independent variable seems to relate to the semi-major axis of planets. 
  Typically, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period or the gravitational force, following Kepler's laws, which suggest a power-law 
  relationship, possibly involving a square or cube relationship.\n\nObserving the data:\n- The values of y increase significantly as x1 increases.
  \n- The largest jump is between x1 = 1.524 and x1 = 5.2, suggesting a non-linear relationship.\n- Given the context of planetary systems, 
  the relationship might be quadratic or cubic due to the nature of gravitational physics (Kepler's third law suggests a cube relationship with 
  semi-major axes).\n\nPotential simple expressions:\n1. 
  A quadratic relationship could model this (e.g., c0 * x1^2).\n2. A cubic relationship might fit better due to the nature of orbital mechanics 
  (e.g., c1 * x1^3).\n3. A square root or logarithmic relationship might also be plausible given the data growth pattern 
  (e.g., c2 * sqrt(x1) or c3 * log(x1)).\n\nLet's propose expressions that capture these potential relationships.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. From the dataset, it appears we're dealing with a non-linear relationship between the planet index (x1) and the semi-major axis (y).\n2. Reviewing the Pareto front, the equation with the lowest MSE is 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*sqrt(x1)+c[2]*x1', which suggests that a polynomial expression might be appropriate.\n3. We need to suggest 3 new equations that balance complexity and accuracy. Given the dataset's nature (semi-major axis), it's reasonable to explore polynomial, power, and exponential forms:\n   - A polynomial form with a lower complexity might be 'c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*x1', which has already shown good performance.\n   - We can also consider a power form like 'c[0]*x1**1.5', which captures a power relationship with lower complexity.\n   - An exponential form like 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' might capture growth behavior, but we need to keep complexity in check.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following expressions were derived:\n- 'c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*x1' captures a quadratic relationship with low complexity and good MSE.\n- 'c[0]*x1**1.5' introduces a lower complexity power model.\n- 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' introduces an exponential form with a reasonable complexity.",
