The goal is to find new equations that minimize both complexity and loss while providing diverse expressions.\n\n- The dataset suggests a relationship between the planet index (x1) and the semi-major axis (y), which could indicate a non-linear pattern since the semi-major axis tends to increase significantly with the planet index.\n- The existing equations vary in complexity and loss, with the simplest having a complexity of 4 and the most complex 11. The mean squared error (mse) ranges from about 0.85 to over 3 million.\n- The best-performing equation in terms of mse is the most complex one: 'c[0]*x1**c[1]+c[2]*x1', with an mse of 0.85729726.\n- Considering the existing equations, I need to avoid SR-similar expressions and find diverse forms.\n\nStrategy:\n1. Use non-linear transformations like powers and logarithms, which seem promising given the dataset's pattern.\n2. Consider simple polynomials or combinations of polynomials and logs, as these provide a good balance between complexity and flexibility.\n3. Avoid redundancy and simplicity in constants to provide distinct model structures.\n4. Ensure the expressions are diverse by mixing different operators and transformations.\n\nPossible New Expressions:\n1. c[0] * x1**2 + c[1] * log(x1) + c[2]\n   - Combines quadratic and logarithmic terms to capture non-linear trends.\n   - Complexity is moderate.\n2. c[0] * sqrt(x1) + c[1] * x1**3\n   - Uses a combination of square root and cubic transformation for diversity.\n3. c[0] / x1 + c[1] * exp(x1)\n   - Mixes reciprocal and exponential forms, which might capture different non-linear patterns.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n1. The existing equations show a wide range of complexities and mean squared errors (mse). We need to find better expressions that minimize both complexity and mse while being diverse.\n2. The dataset is small, and the independent variable x1 seems to relate to the semi-major axis.\n3. The existing best mse is 0.857 with a complexity of 9, using the equation c[0]*x1**c[1]+c[2]*x1.\n4. Analyzing the data, the relationship might be non-linear, potentially quadratic, cubic, or involving roots or logs.\n5. We should emphasize diversity among the suggestions, ensuring they are not SR-similar to each other or the existing equations.\n6. Let's try using combinations of square, cube, sqrt, and log, as these transformations might capture the non-linearity.\n\nSome potential new equations:\n1. c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]*x1**0.5: A combination of square and square root.\n2. c[0]*x1 + c[1]/x1 + c[2]: Linear plus inverse relation.\n3. c[0]*log(x1) + c[1]*x1**2: Logarithmic and quadratic combination.\n\nEach of these attempts to capture non-linear patterns without being SR-similar to the provided equations.",
