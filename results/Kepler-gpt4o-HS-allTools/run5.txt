However, since we do not have the orbital period here, we will focus on simple polynomial and power relationships.\n   \n4.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Review the existing expressions:\n   - The dataset involves a planetary index (x1) and semi-major axis (y).\n   - We have a complexity range from 5 to 14, with varying MSEs.\n   - Lower complexity expressions like 'c[0]*x1**c[1]' have relatively low MSE, indicating simpler power laws work well.\n\n2. Analyze the dataset:\n   - The independent variable x1 has values ranging from 0.389 to 9.51.\n   - The dependent variable y ranges from 87.77 to 10759.2.\n   - This indicates a possible polynomial or power relationship.\n\n3. Suggestions for new expressions:\n   - Aim for diverse expressions with varying complexity, ensuring low MSE while not being SR-similar to existing expressions.\n\n4. Potential new expressions:\n   - Consider an expression using division: 'c[0] + c[1]/x1'\n   - Use the cube function for variety: 'c[0]*x1**3 + c[1]'\n   - Introduce a log function: 'c[0]*log(x1) + c[1]*x1'\n\n5. Ensure these suggestions are diverse in terms of mathematical operations used.",
