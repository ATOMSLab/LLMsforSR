- The given dataset seems to represent the semi-major axis of 
  planets in a solar system, which typically follows Kepler's Third Law. Kepler's Third Law suggests 
  that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. 
  However, since we are looking at semi-major axis as a function of planet index, we need to explore 
  possible non-linear relations.
- The initial expression is quite simple and involves only 
  the square of x1, which might not capture the complexity of the dataset accurately.
- 
  To suggest diverse expressions, let's consider various combinations of operations and functions:
  

1. Polynomial forms: 
   
  - Consider using cube of x1 since the data might follow a power law.

2. 
  Logarithmic and Exponential forms:
   - Logarithmic and exponential forms can capture non-linear 
  relations. However, the limitation here is that the data does not suggest exponential growth or decay.
   But a logarithmic relation might help with fitting.

3. Combinations:
   
   - A combination of powers with basic operations might yield better results.

Given these c...

1. **Observation of Data**:
   - The independent variable `x1` ranges from small values (<1) to larger values (>9).
   - The dependent variable `y` increases significantly, indicating a possible polynomial or exponential relationship.
   - The dataset represents a planetary system, possibly indicating a physical law 
  like Kepler's Third Law or other orbital mechanics.

2. 
  **Analysis of Previous Suggestions**:
   - `exp(c[0]*x1)`: This expression has high complexity and very high MSE. Exponential growth is too rapid for the data.
   - `c[0]*x1**3`: This expression has moderate complexity and relatively high MSE, may indicate overfitting or inappropriate power.
   - `c[0]*x1**2`: Lower complexity and lower MSE, indicating a quadratic relationship may fit better.

3. **Generating New Expressions**:
   - We aim for simplicity and low MSE, considering physical relevance and avoiding SR-similarity.
   - Expressions like `c[0] + c[1]*x1` can model linear relationships and may be a good baseline.
   - A square root can model sublinear growth, e.g., `c[0] * sqrt(x1)`.
   - A logarithmic relationship can model slow growth and is relevant for scaling laws, e.g., `c[0] * log(x1)`.

4. **Diverse Expression Suggestions**:

Analyzing the dataset, 
  we have:
- x1 = [0.389, 0.724, 1.0, 1.524, 5.2, 9.51]
- y = [87.77, 224.7, 365.25, 686.95, 4332.62, 10759.2]
  

The dataset represents a planetary system where the independent variable seems to relate to the semi-major axis of planets. 
  Typically, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period or the gravitational force, following Kepler's laws, which suggest a power-law 
  relationship, possibly involving a square or cube relationship.

Observing the data:
- The values of y increase significantly as x1 increases.
  
- The largest jump is between x1 = 1.524 and x1 = 5.2, suggesting a non-linear relationship.
- Given the context of planetary systems, 
  the relationship might be quadratic or cubic due to the nature of gravitational physics (Kepler's third law suggests a cube relationship with 
  semi-major axes).

Potential simple expressions:
1. 
  A quadratic relationship could model this (e.g., c0 * x1^2).
2. A cubic relationship might fit better due to the nature of orbital mechanics 
  (e.g., c1 * x1^3).
3. A square root or logarithmic relationship might also be plausible given the data growth pattern 
  (e.g., c2 * sqrt(x1) or c3 * log(x1)).

Let's propose expressions that capture these potential relationships....

   - x1: [0.389, 0.724, 1.0, 1.524, 5.2, 9.51 ]

2. Consider potential transformations:

   - Consider polynomial transformations like square or cube.
   - Consider exponential or logarithmic transformations.

3. Try to identify the simplest transformation:
   - Upon visual inspection and considering planetary systems, an exponential relationship might fit (Kepler's third law).

4. Formulate expressions:
   - y could be modeled as a power function of x1.
   - Potential expressions:
     a. y = c0 * x1**c1
     b. y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)
     c. y = c0 * x1**2 + c1

5. Evaluate the closeness of fit:
   - Need to balance between simplicity and accuracy.

7. `c[0]*x1**c[1]`: Complexity 5, MSE 5.8078803

The goal is to suggest new equations that balance complexity and MSE, exploring different functional forms to minimize redundancy.

Analyzing the dataset and the existing equations:

- The best equation so far is `c[0]*x1**c[1]` with the lowest MSE and complexity. This suggests a power relationship.
- There's a balance between polynomial terms (e.g., `x1**2`, `x1`) and exponential or logarithmic forms that haven't been fully explored.
- Given that it's a planetary system, there might be a physical relationship that resembles Kepler's laws or similar gravitational relationships, which often involve inverse or squared terms.

Strategies for new expressions:
- Explore logarithmic relationships since logarithms can linearize certain power laws.
- Investigate combinations of exponents and roots that haven't been tried.
- Try expressions that involve division, which could represent inverse relationships.

Potential new equations:

1. Consider using a logarithmic transformation: `c[0] * log(x1) + c[1]` (captures exponential relationships).
2. Explore a mix of powers and roots: `c[0]*x1**2.5 + c[1]*x1**0.5` (combines high powers with roots).
3. Use division to capture potential inverse relationships: `c[0]/(x1 + c[1]) + c[2]` (could model an inverse square law)....

First, observe the trend of y in relation to x1. Given the dataset represents a planetary system, we might expect some physical laws to be at play. 

1. Analyzing the values:
   - x1 (planet index): [0.389, 0.724, 1.0, 1.524, 5.2, 9.51]
   - y (semi-major axis): [87.77, 224.7, 365.25, 686.95, 4332.62, 10759.2]

2. The values of y seem to increase rapidly with x1. This rapid increase suggests a non-linear relationship. Let's explore potential mathematical relationships:

3. Potential expressions:
   - Given the nature of planetary orbits, the semi-major axis (a) could be related to the orbital period (T) through Kepler's third law: T² ∝ a³. However, since we do not have the orbital period here, we will focus on simple polynomial and power relationships.
   
4. Attempting polynomial and power relationships:
   - y ~ c0 * x1**c1
   - y ~ c0 + c1 * x1**2
   - y ~ c0 * exp(c1 * x1)

5. Simplifying the expressions based on the available operators:
   - y ~ c0 * x1**c1 can be approximated using cube or square.
   - y ~ c0 + c1 * x1**2 makes use of the square operation.
   - y ~ c0 * exp(c1 * x1) uses the exp operation.

Let's propose expressions based on these analyses....

1. Analyzing the dataset: The dependent variable y seems to increase non-linearly with respect to the independent variable x1. Given this is about a planetary system, Kepler's third law suggests a relation of the form y ∝ x1^2 or y ∝ x1^(3/2). 

2. Current equations and their performance:
   - `c[0]+c[1]*x1**(1/3)`: High MSE and complexity.
   - `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)`: Better MSE, lower complexity.
   - `c[0]+c[1]*x1**2`: Good MSE, moderate complexity.
   - `c[0]*x1**c[1]`: Excellent MSE, low complexity.
   - `c[0]*x1**c[1]+c[2]*log(x1)`: Best MSE but highest complexity.

3. Avoiding SR-similar expressions: 
   - Since `c[0]*x1**c[1]` performs well, we should avoid simple power laws that are SR-similar like `x1**c[1]` or `c[0]/x1**c[1]`.

4. Strategy for new expressions:
   - Consider expressions involving log or exp to introduce non-linearity without increasing complexity too much.
   - Combine power laws with basic operations to introduce diversity.

5. Potential new equations:
   - `c[0] * x1**2 + c[1] * log(x1)`: Introduces a logarithmic term for diversity.
   - `c[0] * sqrt(x1) + c[1] * x1`: Combines square root and linear terms for diversity.

Given the dataset and the task, we need to identify new expressions that are non-linear and have a balance between complexity and mean squared error (MSE). We should aim to minimize both these factors, while ensuring the expressions are diverse and not SR-similar to those previously suggested.

The dataset involves a relationship between a planetary index (x1) and the semi-major axis (y), which suggests a physical relationship that could follow Kepler's laws, potentially involving powers or exponential functions.

The previous expressions cover a range of complexities and MSE values. Here's a breakdown of the trade-offs in the dataset:

- Lower complexity expressions often have higher MSE. For example, 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' has low complexity but high error.
- Higher complexity expressions like 'c[0]*x1**c[1]+c[2]*x1**2' achieve significantly lower MSE.
- Certain power law expressions like 'c[0]*x1**c[1]' achieve a good balance with low complexity and low MSE.

To improve upon this, we can explore combinations of unary operators (e.g., sqrt, log, exp) and power laws to generate new expressions. It's important to ensure diversity by incorporating different mathematical forms, avoiding redundant expressions.

Possible new expressions:
1. An expression using logarithm and powers: Using log(x1) can introduce a different non-linear behavior.
2. A mixture of power and exponential: Combining x1**2 and exp(x1) can offer new dynamics.

1. Analyze the dataset and existing equations for patterns:
   - Observing the dependent variable (y) values, there is a steep increase from the 4th to 5th data point which suggests a polynomial or exponential relationship.
   - The independent variable (x1) values range from approximately 0.4 to 9.5.
   - Given the context of a planetary system, semi-major axes often follow Kepler's third law, indicating a potential power-law relationship.

2. Review of existing equations:
   - The simplest equations: `c[0]*x1**c[1]` and `c[0]*x1**c[1]/x1` have minimal complexity (5 and 7) with low MSE (5.8078803).
   - More complex equations like `c[0]*x1**c[1]+c[2]*sqrt(x1)+c[3]` have an MSE of 0.05514792 but higher complexity of 12.

3. Aim to find diverse and non-SR-similar equations with low complexity and MSE:
   - Consider transformations that apply square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp or different combinations of them.
   - Ensure to not simply replicate existing patterns or combinations that lead to SR-similar expressions.

4. Generate new potential equations:
   - Using `sqrt` and `cube` to explore different non-linear transformations.
   - Avoid using existing patterns directly to ensure diversity.
