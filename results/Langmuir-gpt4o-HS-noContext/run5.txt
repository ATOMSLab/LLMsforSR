  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n1. Analyzing the dataset: The values of y decrease as x1 decreases. This suggests a possible negative correlation between y and x1. \n\n2. The decrease in y isn't linear; it appears to be nonlinear, so simple linear expressions (like y = c0 * x1 + c1) might not fit well.\n\n3. The relationship could potentially be inverse or power-based. An inverse relationship would imply y = c0 / x1 or y = c0 / x1^c1, which could make sense given the decreasing nature of y as x1 decreases.\n\n4. A power or polynomial relationship could also be considered, such as y = c0 * x1^c1. The decline in y suggests that the exponent might be negative or fractional, indicating a decay.\n\n5. Given the constraints, let's attempt some transformations:\n   - Trying inverse: y = c0 / x1 might capture the sharp decline of y.\n   - Trying square root: y = c0 * sqrt(x1) might capture a gentler decline.\n   - Trying logarithmic: y = c0 * log(x1) might capture a logarithmic decay.\n\n6. We need to consider possible combinations of these transformations, while keeping the expressions concise due to the restrictions.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nAnalyzing the provided data and the existing equations, we aim to find new expressions that balance complexity and mean squared error (MSE) while ensuring they are not SR-similar to existing ones.\n\n1. **Current Analysis**:\n   - The equations provided range in complexity from 3 to 12.\n   - The MSE ranges from 0.212 to 310.24.\n   - The lower the complexity and MSE, the better the equation is balanced in terms of fit and simplicity.\n\n2. **Dataset Observation**:\n   - The dependent variable, y, decreases as the independent variable, x1, decreases.\n   - This suggests a possible inverse or logarithmic relationship.\n\n3. **Existing Equations**:\n   - Simpler ones are of the form c[0]/x1 and c[0]*log(x1).\n   - More complex ones involve combinations like c[0]/sqrt(x1) + c[1] and c[0]*log(x1) + c[1]/sqrt(x1).\n\n4. **Strategy for New Suggestions**:\n   - Use basic functions like inverse, square root, and logarithm, considering their appearance in successful past equations.\n   - Introduce new combinations of functions to avoid SR-similarity.\n   - Maintain complexity around the middle to lower range, ideally not exceeding 10.\n\n5. **Potential New Expressions**:\n   - Consider expressions involving squares or cubes since they aren't heavily seen in the current optimal ones.\n   - Combine different functions to offer diversity, like using exp with inverse or sqrt.\n\nConsidering these observations, here are three new candidate expressions:\n\n1. **Expression 1**: Introduce a square function with an inverse, as this form is not heavily represented.\n   - Example: c[0] / (x1**2 + c[1])\n\n2. **Expression 2**: Mix square root and logarithmic functions.\n   - Example: c[0] * sqrt(x1) + c[1] * log(x1)\n\n3. **Expression 3**: Use exponential and inverse functions.\n   - Example: c[0] * exp(-x1) / x1 + c[1]",
