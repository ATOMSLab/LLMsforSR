Linear decay: y = c0 * x1 + c1\n   - This is a simple model that can be tested for a basic proportional decay.\n\n2.

Logarithmic decay: y = c0 * log(x1) + c1\n   - Logarithmic models are often useful for decay that reduces quickly initially and then levels out.\n\nNote:\n- The dataset suggests a non-linear relationship.
