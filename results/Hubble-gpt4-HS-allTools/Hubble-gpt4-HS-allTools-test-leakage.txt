Looking at the dataset, it appears that the dependent variable, y, increases as the independent variable, x1, increases. This suggests a positive relationship between the two variables. However, the relationship does not appear to be linear. This suggests that a non-linear model may be a better fit for the data.

Additionally, considering the physics context, the Hubble's law could provide a useful analogy for modeling the data. Hubble's law in cosmology states that the speed of separation (v) of a galaxy is proportional to its distance (d) from the observer, given as v = H * d, where H is the Hubble constant.

Based on the Pareto front provided, the simplest equation with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) is 'c[0]*x1', which is similar to Hubble's law. However, this model might not fully capture the non-linearity in the dataset. Thus, we should explore other possible equations.

A few equations that incorporate more complexity while also potentially capturing the non-linearity in the data could include:
- An equation featuring a logarithmic function, which could model a relationship where changes in y decrease as x1 increases.
- An equation featuring an exponential function, which could model a relationship where changes in y increase as x1 increases.
- An equation featuring a square root function, which could model a relationship where changes in...

Looking at the dataset, it appears that the values of y increase as the values of x1 increase, indicating a positive correlation. This could suggest that a function involving multiplication or exponentiation might be a good fit. 

Given the context of the data, it suggests a cosmological relation, reminiscent of Hubble's law, which states that the velocity of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This law is often expressed as v = H0 * d, where v is the velocity (which is the dependent variable y in our case), H0 is the Hubble constant (which could be represented by c0 in our expressions), and d is the distance (which is the independent variable x1 in our case). 

First, I will try the simple linear equation y = c0 * x1, to see if it fits the data appropriately. 

Second, I will try a slightly more complex equation, y = c0 * x1^2, to see if a quadratic relationship might better fit the data. 

Third, I will also try an exponential relationship, y = c0 * exp(x1), to see if this provides a better fit to the data....

Looking at the data, there seems to be a positive correlation between the independent variable x1 (proper distance to a galaxy) and the dependent variable y (speed of separation). This means as x1 increases, y also increases. This could suggest a linear or exponential relationship between the variables.

Considering the cosmological context, the Hubble's law comes to mind, which states that the velocity of a galaxy (speed of separation in this case) is directly proportional to its distance from us. Thus, we can start with a linear equation and then try polynomial and exponential forms to capture any non-linearity.

1. Linear: y = c0 * x1
2. Polynomial: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1
3. Exponential: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)...

Looking at the data provided, and considering the restrictions on the expressions, we can see that there is a non-linear relationship between the proper distance to a galaxy (x1) and its speed of separation (y). 

The current solutions show a mix of exponential, linear, and polynomial equations. 

The equation with the lowest mean square error (mse) is a polynomial of second degree (c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2]), with an mse of 27820.28 and complexity 11. 

The dataset provided is a typical example of Hubble's law in physical cosmology, which states that the velocity of a galaxy moving away from the observer is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This suggests that a linear relationship could be a good fit, but the current solutions already include a linear equation (c[0]*x1) and a polynomial of second degree. 

Given the restrictions, I suggest trying a logarithmic equation, a square root equation, and a cubic equation. These types of equations can capture non-linear relationships and have not been included in the previous solutions.

It's also important to keep in mind that we should keep complexity as low as possible, while still achieving a good fit to the data....

From the given Pareto front, the best fit with least complexity is 'c[0]*x1' with a mean squared error of 31135.22 and complexity of 3. However, we're tasked with suggesting three new equations that minimize both complexity and loss, and that aren't SR-similar to the existing ones. 

The dataset presents a pattern which seems to be in line with the Hubble's law in cosmology, stating that the speed of separation of galaxies is directly proportional to their distance. This is reflected in the best fit 'c[0]*x1'. However, considering the non-linear nature of the universe, we might need to account for some non-linearity in our model. 

We can exploit the unary operators to introduce some non-linearity. However, we must ensure we don't end up suggesting SR-similar expressions. This can be achieved by strategically placing the unary operators in the equations. 

Also, we can play around with the binary operators to introduce more complexity in the model. But the aim should be to keep the complexity as low as possible.

The following three equations might be good candidates:

1. c[0]*log(x1**2)
2. c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*x1**2
3. c[0]*x1**3 - c[1]*x1...

Looking at the data, it seems to be increasing as x1 increases. This indicates that the separation speed of the galaxy increases with distance. This aligns with the Hubble's law in cosmology which states that the velocity of galaxies moving away from the observer is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. The formula for Hubble's law is V = H0 * D where V is the velocity, H0 is the Hubble constant, and D is the distance. 

The problem does not allow fitting constants, so we can use c0 for the Hubble constant. This gives us our first equation as y = c0 * x1.

Given the non-linear nature of the data, other potential fits could include squared and cubed terms of x1. These will give us additional equations as y = c1 * x1^2 and y = c2 * x1^3....

Given the data and constraints, we should explore expressions that have varying degrees of complexity and non-linearity. This is important to ensure that we're not limiting ourselves to a certain type of equation and we can provide a diverse set of suggestions.

We should also consider the physical cosmology context. The Hubble's law states that the speed of separation of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This could suggest a linear relationship between the variables, but we can also explore other relationships given the constraints.

From the provided Pareto front, the suggested equation is linear with a complexity of 3. While this equation is simple, it may not capture any potential non-linear relationships in the data.

Considering these aspects, let's construct three new equations with different complexities:

1. A quadratic equation: c[0]*x1^2. This equation has a complexity of 4 and introduces a non-linear relationship between x1 and y.

2. A logarithmic equation: c[0]*log(x1). This equation has a complexity of 4 and can capture potential logarithmic relationships between x1 and y.

3. An exponential equation: c[0]*exp(x1). This equation has a complexity of 4 and can capture potential exponential relationships between x1 and y....

- The data is about physical cosmology where x1 is the proper distance to a galaxy and y is its speed of separation. Therefore, the equations should follow the Hubble's law which states that the speed of a galaxy (y) is proportional to its distance (x1) from the observer, but it can also have non-linear elements due to the influence of dark energy and matter.
- The provided Pareto front consists of 4 equations, all of which have a complexity between 3 and 6 and a mean squared error (MSE) between 31135.22243454 and 67241.66755131.
- Given the restrictions, the expressions should be constructed using the operators: +, -, *, /, square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp. 
- Since the dataset has only one independent variable, it is only possible to use x1 in the expressions.
- The equations should not be SR-similar to the ones already provided in the Pareto front to avoid redundancy.
- The goal is to find equations that have a lower MSE and/or complexity than the ones in the Pareto front.

Based on these observations, the following three equations can be proposed:

1. "c[0]*log(x1)": This equation, which has a complexity of 4, contains the logarithm of x1, whic...
