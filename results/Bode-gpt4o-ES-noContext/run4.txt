  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe given dataset seems to have a non-linear relationship between the independent variable `x1` and the dependent variable `y`. Since `x1` ranges from -1000 to 6, and `y` values are all positive, an exponential or power relationship could be a good fit.\n\nLet's first try to analyze the trends:\n- For `x1` = -1000, `y` = 0.39, which is quite small.\n- For `x1` = 0, `y` = 0.72.\n- As `x1` moves from 0 to 6, `y` increases significantly from 0.72 to 19.22.\n\nThis suggests an exponential growth pattern from `x1` = 0 onwards. However, for `x1` = -1000, the value is still positive, indicating some offset or additional term might be needed to ensure positivity.\n\nPotential models to consider:\n1. An exponential-like model: `y = exp(c0 * x1) + c1`\n   - The exponential term will ensure rapid growth for positive `x1`.\n   - The `+ c1` term can account for the offset needed at `x1` = -1000.\n\n2. A power model: `y = c0 * x1^c1 + c2`\n   - A power model can describe polynomial-like growth, but might need adjustment for negative `x1`.\n\n3. A combination of linear and exponential: `y = c0 * x1 + exp(c1 * x1)`\n   - This can capture linear growth and exponential growth simultaneously.\n\nGiven the restrictions, the expressions should be simple, yet capture the essence of the data's growth pattern.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n- I've got three equations from the Pareto front analysis. Equations are ranked by their complexity and mean squared error (MSE). Lower complexity is preferable, but high accuracy is important too.\n- The first equation is `c[0]*x1**c[1]+c[2]` with complexity 7 and MSE 124855.78. This is a power function.\n- The second equation `c[0]*x1+exp(c[1]*x1)` has complexity 8 and an MSE of 1.30. It combines a linear term with an exponential term.\n- The third equation `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]` has complexity 8 and a very low MSE of 0.00688. This suggests the exponential component is very effective.\n\nI need to propose three new expressions:\n1. Avoid power function similar to `c[0]*x1**c[1]`.\n2. Avoid expressions that are linear combinations, like `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1` or similar.\n3. Avoid expressions that are linear with added exponential terms unless the structure is significantly different from the second and third equation.\n\nPossible new expressions:\n1. An expression that focuses on exponential behavior: `exp(c[0] + c[1]*x1)`. This is different from the given exponential equations as it uses an exponent without multiplication by a constant.\n2. A ratio-based expression: `c[0] / (c[1] + x1)`. This introduces a rational form which hasn't been suggested yet.\n3. A combination of exponential and rational form: `c[0] * exp(x1) / (c[1] + x1)`.
