  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Initial Analysis:\n   - The dataset suggests some sort of exponential growth pattern. The values start small and increase rapidly, which is typical of exponential functions.\n   - The independent variable x1 ranges from -1000 to 6, which is quite wide and may indicate a need for handling negative values in a specific way.\n\n2. Simple Approximations:\n   - A linear approximation is unlikely to fit well due to the rapid increase in y.\n   - A polynomial might work, but to keep it simple, we should consider low-degree polynomials.\n\n3. Exponential Function:\n   - An exponential form like exp(c0 * x1) could be a reasonable starting point, given the exponential-like increase in y.\n\n4. Power Function:\n   - A power law form like x1^c0 might also work, particularly if it can handle negative inputs meaningfully.\n\n5. Consideration of Offsets:\n   - Offsets (shifts in x1) might be necessary since the exponential growth doesn't start until a certain point in the x1 range.\n\n6. Specific Ideas:\n   - exp(c0 * x1): A simple exponential growth based on x1.\n   - c0 * x1^c1: A power function with adjustable exponent.\n   - c0 * exp(x1/c1): Exponential with a scaling factor for x1.",

The exponential function seems to provide a good fit with low mse, as seen from 'exp(c[0]*x1)' and 'c[0]*exp(x1/c[1])'.\n\n4. We should explore variations that combine linear, polynomial, and exponential forms while keeping complexity low.\n\n5. Since exponentials work well, try expressions that use the form c0*exp(x1/c1) but adjust the structure to avoid SR-similarity.\n\n6. Quadratic forms may be explored as a slight variation to capture potential non-linear patterns: c0*x1^2 + c1*x1.\n\n7. Consider simple polynomial forms with division to add variety, e.g., c0*x1 / (c1 + x1).\n\n8.

A simple power law: \"c[0]*x1^c[1]\" - Power law allows for non-linear transformations and can provide a different fit.\n2. An exponential expression with a polynomial: \"c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1) + c[2]*x1^2\" - Combines the strength of exponential with polynomial.\n3. A rational expression with an exponential term in the denominator: \"c[0]/(1 + exp(-c[1]*x1))\" - A sigmoid-like expression that is different from existing functions.\n\nThese suggestions aim to provide diverse approaches to fitting the data, focusing on different mathematical operations and combinations.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe goal is to propose three new equations that minimize complexity and mean squared error (mse) while avoiding SR-similar expressions to those already given.\n\n1. First, let's analyze the dataset:\n   - The independent variable x1 ranges from -1000 to 6.\n   - The dependent variable y appears to be increasing rapidly, especially for higher values of x1, suggesting a possible exponential relationship.\n\n2. Analyze existing equations:\n   - The equations `c[0]/(x1+c[1])` and `c[0]+c[1]/(x1+c[2])` are rational functions but have relatively high mse.\n   - The exponential-based equations like `exp(c[0]*x1)` and `c[0]*exp(x1/c[1])` have much lower mse, indicating exponential terms fit the data well.\n   - `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]` has the lowest mse among the given equations.\n\n3. Avoid SR-similar expressions:\n   - Avoid expressions that are simple variations of existing ones, such as changing sign of constants or consolidating constants.\n   - Consider combining different operators and structures to generate diverse expressions.\n\n4. Propose new equations:\n   - Focus on exponential and polynomial terms, as these seem to capture the data behavior well.\n   - Consider combining exponential and polynomial terms in new ways for diversity.\n\nBased on these observations, here are three new equations to suggest:",
