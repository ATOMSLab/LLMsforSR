  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The provided dataset has a clear exponential growth pattern in the dependent variable `y` with respect to the independent variable `x1`, as observed from y-values [0.39, 0.72, 1, 1.52, 2.77, 5.2, 9.58, 19.22].\n\n2. Previous expressions indicate that exponential functions provide better fits, as seen with lower MSE values for equations including `exp()`.\n\n3. The target is to minimize both complexity and loss. An equation with exponential terms and a few additive or multiplicative terms might help achieve this.\n\n4. Avoid SR-similar expressions from the list. For example, expressions like 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' or 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]' are already present, so consider variations.\n\n5. Consider simpler structures with exponential components since they seem to capture the growth pattern well, but try to add diversity by including division or polynomial terms.\n\n6. A basic polynomial or rational function component may add diversity without increasing complexity significantly.\n\n7. Let's include a polynomial term, a rational term, and an exponential term with a slight twist for diversity.",
