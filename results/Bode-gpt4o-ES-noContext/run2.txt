Consider exponential relationships:\n   - Simple exponential: y = c0 * exp(c1*x1)\n\n4. Check for possible power relationships:\n   - Power function: y = c0 * x1^c1\n\n5. Analyze potential fits:\n   - The rapid growth of y for larger x1 values suggests a polynomial or exponential might fit better.\n   - Polynomial expressions can capture the curvature in the dataset.\n\n6.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the dataset and suggested equations, let's analyze what's already been proposed and come up with new equations:\n\n1. The dataset shows a strong growth pattern, potentially exponential, given the rapid increase in y values.\n2. The existing equations cover a range of complexities and model types:\n   - Linear models (e.g., 'c[0] + c[1]*x1')\n   - Polynomial models (e.g., 'c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1**2')\n   - Exponential models (e.g., 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)')\n   - Mixed models combining exponential and polynomial terms (e.g., 'c[0]+c[1]*exp(c[2]*x1)+c[3]*x1')\n3. The best performing models (in terms of mse) are the ones that incorporate exponential growth with complexity ranging from 6 to 14.\n4. To suggest diverse new equations, we need to balance between adding complexity to account for the exponential growth and keeping the model simple to reduce overfitting and maintain interpretability.\n\nLet's propose three new equations:\n- Consider using a combination of polynomial and exponential terms, as they perform well.\n- Avoid SR-similar expressions to what's already been proposed.\n\nNew Suggestions:\n1. 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*exp(x1)' - Combines linear and exponential growth.\n2. 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1) + c[2]/(c[3]+x1)' - Exp and reciprocal term to account for rapid growth and saturation.\n3. 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1) - c[2]*x1^2' - Exponential term with a polynomial subtraction to model potential decrease after rapid growth.",
