First, observe the behavior of y with respect to x1:\n   - At x1 = -1000, y = 0.39\n   - At x1 = 0, y = 0.72\n   - As x1 increases, y increases rapidly.\n   \n2. Consider simple polynomial expressions:\n   - A linear expression like y = c0*x1 + c1 won't work because it cannot capture the rapid increase of y.\n   - A quadratic expression y = c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2 might be too simplistic unless coefficients are large.\n   \n3. Consider exponential expressions:\n   - Exponential growth is characterized by rapid increase, so y = exp(c0*x1) or y = c0*exp(c1*x1) could be plausible.\n   \n4. Consider rational expressions:\n   - A form like y = c0 / (x1 + c1) isn't likely to work well due to the positive slope as x1 increases.\n\n5. Try to identify a possible fit:\n   - Given the values of y, it seems like an exponential or higher-order polynomial might fit well.\n   - Exponential form: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)\n   - Polynomial form: y = c0 * x1^3 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1\n\n6.
