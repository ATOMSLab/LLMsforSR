Analyzing the dataset and given the topic of physical cosmology, the speed of separation of a galaxy is expected to have a linear relationship with the proper distance, according to Hubble's Law. Therefore, a simple linear regression model like y = c0*x1 seems appropriate.

However, since the task requires three expressions, considering a few variations of the simple linear model might be helpful. For example, an expression like y = c0*x1 + c1 can account for a non-zero intercept, which might be relevant in some cosmological contexts.

Lastly, a more complex relationship like y = c0*(x1/c1) could also be considered, which might correspond to a situation where the speed of separation is inversely proportional to some constant....

Looking at the given equations, it's clear that they all are linear equations of the form y = mx + c. They represent the relationship between the distance of a galaxy and its speed of separation, which is typically proportional according to Hubble's law in cosmology. This suggests the dataset follows a linear pattern.

Given the restrictions on the type of equations we can propose, we need to maintain the linear relationship while introducing some variation to diversify the equations. We can do this by manipulating the order of the terms and the use of constants.

However, we need to be careful to avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions. This means we should avoid flipping signs or consolidating constants. This leaves us with few options, but we can still propose a few different equations that maintain the linear relationship while introducing some variation....

Looking at the dataset and the provided equations, it seems like the data follows a pattern where the speed of separation is proportional to the distance, which is in line with Hubble's law in cosmology. 

We can mix and match the operators to form new equations that satisfy the constraints mentioned. The equations suggested earlier have complexities ranging from 3 to 9, and the mean square error reduces as the complexity increases. However, the aim is to find a balance between complexity and accuracy.

The following three equations are diverse and follow the guidelines provided: 

1. Equation of the form c0*x1 + c1: This is a linear equation with a constant term. It has a complexity of 5 and is different from the provided equations.

2. Equation of the form c0*x1*c1: This equation introduces a multiplication of x1 with two constants. It has a complexity of 5.

3. Equation of the form c0/(x1+c1): This equation presents a different structure where x1 is in the denominator with a constant. It has a complexity of 6....

The dataset can be approximated by a linear model since the speed of separation of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This relation is known as Hubble's law in physical cosmology.

Possible expressions could be a simple linear model, a quadratic model, and a reciprocal model. The linear model will be a simple direct relationship between x1 and y. The quadratic model will include a squared term, and the reciprocal model will include a term with 1/x1....

      ...The given dataset appears to be a classic example of Hubble's law in physical cosmology, which states that the speed of separation of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This implies a linear relationship between the variables, y and x1.

However, since we are expected to suggest three different expressions, we can also think of quadratic and inverse relationships. The quadratic relationship could account for possible nonlinear effects at larger distances, while the inverse relationship could represent a hypothetical scenario where the speed decreases with distance....

Looking at the dataset, it's clear that the existing equations are in polynomial and rational form with the variable x1 and constants c0 and c1. The dataset represents the Hubble's law in cosmology, which normally is a linear relationship between the speed of a galaxy and its distance from the observer. However, the given equations are non-linear and we're restricted to non-complex unary operators. We need to suggest equations which are not SR-similar to the existing ones. We should consider adding more terms involving the variable x1 and constants to increase the diversity. Also, we should try to keep the complexity low to maintain simplicity....

Given the data is about physical cosmology, we can draw a parallel to Hubble's law, in which the speed of separation is proportional to the distance. Hence, we can start with the linear equation y = c0 * x1. 

Another possible equation is a quadratic one, which can represent the effects of dark matter/energy on the speed of separation. This equation can take the form y = c0 * x1^2. 

Lastly, we can also consider the inverse relationship, which will be useful for very large distances where the speed of separation becomes constant. This equation can be represented as y = c0 / x1....

Looking at the provided Pareto front, the equations seem to be based around two main formats, 'c[0]*x1' and 'c[0]*x1**2'. The equation 'c[0]*x1' has the lowest complexity but relatively high mse, while 'c[0]*x1**2' has a higher complexity but lower mse. The other two equations seem to be variants of these two formats with additional terms.

We want to minimize both complexity and mse, so it would be beneficial to find equations that are somewhat in the middle of these two extremes. Also, considering the problem is about physical cosmology, it might be useful to consider equations that could possibly represent the Hubble's law, which describes the expansion of the universe.

In order to provide diverse solutions, we'll generate equations based on the provided formats, but with some variations. Also, we'll keep in mind to avoid SR-similar expressions....

From the given Pareto front, we can see that the Mean Square Error (MSE) decreases as the complexity of the equation increases. However, the rate of decrease in MSE tends to slow down as the complexity increases beyond a certain point. Therefore, it may not always be beneficial to increase the complexity, especially when the gain in accuracy is marginal.

The existing equations are primarily based on simple operations involving the variable x1. There are no equations with higher powers of x1, except for the first equation with 'x1**2'. 

Considering the restrictions and the aim to minimize both complexity and loss, we may explore expressions that involve division, as none of the previous expressions included it. We also need to ensure that the new suggestions are not SR-similar to the existing ones.

Given the physical context of the problem (cosmology), the Hubble's law suggests a linear relation between the distance to a galaxy and its speed of separation. However, more complex models may involve quadratic or reciprocal relations, especially when considering the effects of dark energy.

We should ensure that the new equations are diverse and not SR-similar to the existing ones....
