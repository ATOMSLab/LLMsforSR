Therefore, a simple linear regression model like y = c0*x1 seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, since the task requires three expressions, considering a few variations of the simple linear model might be helpful. For example, an expression like y = c0*x1 + c1 can account for a non-zero intercept, which might be relevant in some cosmological contexts.\n\nLastly, a more complex relationship like y = c0*(x1/c1) could also be considered, which might correspond to a situation where the speed of separation is inversely proportional to some constant.",

The equation 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)' had a relatively low mse and complexity of 11. A simpler equivalent expression without an additional constant can be 'c[0]*x1+x1/(c[1]+x1)'.\n\n2. Another equation can be derived from the equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)', which has relatively low mse and complexity of 7. By adding an additional constant, we can form 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]' which might yield better results. \n\n3. The simplest equation 'c[0]*x1' with complexity of 3, can be slightly modified to 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1' as this increases complexity only by 2 and might give better fitting.\n\nIt's important to remember that these are only suggestions and the mse of these equations needs to be calculated to find the most optimal equation.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the previous equations, it seems that the complexity of the equations increases as more constants are added. However, adding the constants also reduces the mean square error (MSE), indicating a better fit to the data. The challenge here is to balance complexity and accuracy. \n\nGiven that the MSE decreases with the addition of constants, it might be beneficial to introduce additional constants in the equations, while keeping their structure as simple as possible to limit complexity. \n\nConsidering the restrictions, I will avoid complex unary operators and will only use the arithmetic operators. Also, I will make sure not to suggest SR-similar expressions. Here are a few expressions that attempt to minimize complexity and loss:\n\n1. 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1'\n2. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1 + 1)'\n3.
