The current equations provided seem to follow a pattern of adding more terms to the equation to reduce the mse. We can suggest some equations that follow a similar pattern but with different structures to provide diversity.\n\n1. The first equation 'c[0]+c[1]/x1' is a simple linear equation with a division operation. We can introduce multiplication to provide diversity. 'c[0]*x1+c[1]' is a simple linear equation but the relation is established through multiplication.\n\n2. The second equation 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]/x1' seems to be a hybrid of linear and inverse relation. We can modify this to provide diversity by switching the order of terms 'c[0]*x1+c[1]/x1+c[2]'.\n\n3. The third equation 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]/x1+c[3]*x1*x1' is a mix of linear, inverse and quadratic relations.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the dataset, it seems like the dependent variable, y, increases as the independent variable, x1, increases. However, the rate of increase of y tends to slow down as x1 increases. This suggests that the relationship might be more complex than a simple linear relationship.\n\nFurther, from the previous equations given, it seems like the equations that perform better (lower MSE) tend to involve both x1 and terms involving 1/x1 or x1^2. This suggests that the relationship is not just dependent on x1, but also on its inverse or its square.\n\nGiven these observations, and the constraints that we can only use the operators +, -, *, and /, and cannot use any complex unary operators, here are three equations that could potentially describe the relationship while being diverse and having low complexity:\n\n1. c0*x1 + c1/x1 - c2*x1*x1\n2. c0/x1 + c1*x1 - c2\n3. c0*x1 - c1/x1 + c2*x1*x1\n\nAll three equations involve both x1 and terms involving 1/x1 or x1^2, which seems to be important for achieving a lower MSE. The first and third equations involve both x1 and x1^2, while the second equation does not involve x1^2. This provides some diversity in the types of relationships being modeled. \n\nFinally, all three equations have a complexity of 11, which is relatively low compared to some of the previous equations given. This makes them simpler and potentially easier to understand and interpret.",

The goal is to minimize the mean square error (MSE) while also keeping the complexity low.\n\n1. We already have a simple linear equation 'c[0]*x1' with complexity 3.

The simplest expression in the front is 'c[0]', which is a constant. The next simplest is 'c[0]*x1', which is a simple linear function. The complexity increases as we add more terms and/or divide by expressions with multiple terms.\n\nGiven the constraints, we have to be careful about not suggesting SR-similar expressions. That rules out simple variations of the expressions in the front, such as changing the sign of a term or combining constants.\n\nSince the dataset seems to follow a non-linear pattern, it's likely that we will need to use multiplication and/or division to get a good fit. However, we also need to keep the complexity low, so we can't add too many terms.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are three new expressions that might work:\n\n1. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)': This is similar to some of the expressions in the front, but not SR-similar. It's a simple ratio with two terms, so the complexity is fairly low.\n\n2. 'c[0]*x1*x1/(c[1]+x1)': This is a slightly more complex ratio with three terms. It might fit the data better, especially if there's a quadratic relationship between x1 and y.\n\n3. '(c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1)/(c[2]+x1*x1)': This is a ratio with four terms, so it's more complex.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the data, the y values seem to increase with x1, suggesting a positive correlation. However, the rate of increase seems to slow down, suggesting a non-linear relationship, possibly logarithmic or square root. Given the constraints on the types of equations allowed, a logarithmic or square root relationship cannot be directly expressed. \n\nHowever, we can express this slowing rate of increase using division, where the denominator increases faster than the numerator. This is seen in the equations with the lowest mse in the Pareto front.\n\nLooking at the Pareto front, the expressions with the lowest mse are also the most complex. To suggest new equations that are both less complex and have a potentially lower mse, we can look at simplifying these complex equations. For example, the equation '(c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1+c[2])/(c[3]+x1)' can be simplified by removing the constant term in the numerator. Similarly, the equation '(c[0]*x1+c[1])/(c[2]*x1*x1+c[3]*x1+c[4])' can be simplified by removing the constant term in the denominator.\n\nWe can also consider adding a constant term to the simpler equations in the Pareto front. For example, the equation 'c[0]*x1' can be modified to include a constant term in the denominator. \n\nLastly, we can consider mixing elements from different equations in the Pareto front. For example, we can take the division structure from the complex equations and combine it with the simpler 'c[0]*x1' term.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided Pareto front, it is clear that the most accurate models have very high complexity. Looking at the equations, there are a few patterns that could be simplified or extended to provide new equations. \n\n1. Linear models: These models are very simple and have higher error. However, they form the base for more complex models and can be extended in a simple way to provide slightly more complex but potentially more accurate models.\n2. Quadratic models: These models have slightly higher complexity but considerably lower error. They include terms of the form c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1 which could be extended to include higher order terms.\n3. Rational models: These models have the form (c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1+c[2])/(c[3]*x1+c[4]*x1*x1) and have the lowest error but very high complexity. They could potentially be simplified while maintaining accuracy.\n\nTaking these observations into account, I suggest the following three new equations:\n1. A linear model with a reciprocal term: c[0]*x1 + c[1]/x1. This is slightly more complex than a pure linear model but may increase accuracy.\n2. A quadratic model with a reciprocal term: c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1*x1 + c[2]/x1. This is an extension of the quadratic models already seen in the Pareto front.\n3.

It might be possible to simplify these while still maintaining a good fit.
