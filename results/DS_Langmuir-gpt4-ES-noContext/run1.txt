A simple linear equation: y = c0 + c1*x1.\n2. A quadratic equation, since the increase in y with respect to x1 seems to be slowing down and quadratic equations capture this well: y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1*x1.\n3.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the dataset, we can see that as x1 increases, y also increases but at a decreasing rate. This suggests that the relationship may be of a logarithmic nature. However, since we can't use complex unary operators like log, we will need to create expressions that mimic this relationship in a simplified way.\n\nLet's start by using the simplest possible equation, a linear one: c[0] + c[1]*x1. This equation is already in the Pareto front with a complexity of 5 and an MSE of 0.03418604, so we can't use it again.\n\nNext, we can try adding a quadratic term to account for the non-linearity: c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1^2. This equation is also in the Pareto front with a complexity of 11 and an MSE of 0.01043916, so we can't use it again.\n\nAnother option could be to divide by x1, which may help mimic a logarithmic relationship: c[0] + c[1]/x1. This equation is in the Pareto front with a complexity of 5 and an MSE of 0.07119782, so we can't use it again.\n\nWe can also try using a higher degree polynomial, such as a cubic one: c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1^2 + c[3]*x1^3. However, this is likely to have a higher complexity and may overfit the data.\n\nWe can also try using a combination of the above options, such as c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]/x1 or c[0] + c[1]*x1^2 + c[2]/x1. These options are more complex, but they may provide a better fit to the data.\n\nAnother option could be to subtract a constant divided by x1 from a linear expression, such as c[0] + c[1]*x1 - c[2]/x1. This is similar to the previous option, but it may provide a different fit to the data.\n\nLastly, we could try using a rational function, such as c[0] + c[1]/(c[2] + x1). This is a more complex option, but it may provide a good fit to the data, especially if the relationship is indeed logarithmic.",

The provided Pareto front shows rational and polynomial expressions with varying complexity and mean square error (mse). \n\nLooking at the dataset, it seems the dependent variable 'y' is increasing as 'x1' increases. We need to provide diverse expressions that capture this behaviour and minimize both complexity and loss. \n\nSince we are restricted to only four operators: +, -, *, / and no complex unary operators, we can create expressions by combining these operators and the independent variable 'x1'. We also need to keep in mind that we should avoid SR-similar expressions to the ones already provided.\n\nBased on these observations, I suggest the following three new equations which are diverse and should have low complexity and loss:\n\n1. c0*x1 + c1*x1**2: This is a polynomial of degree 2, which should capture the increasing trend of the data. \n\n2. c0/(x1 + c1) - c2/x1: This is a rational function with a subtraction operator, which should provide a different approximation compared to the ones already provided.\n\n3. c0*x1/(x1 + c1): This is a rational function with only a single variable 'x1', which should be simpler than the other expressions.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the equations provided, it seems like the ones with the lowest MSE tend to involve both division and addition/subtraction. This is interesting because these operations often provide more complexity, yet they're leading to more accurate results here. It might be worth exploring expressions that combine these operations in various ways.\n\nHowever, we need to avoid SR-similar expressions to the ones already suggested. While an equation like 'c[0]/(x1+c[1])' has low complexity and low MSE, we can't simply suggest a similar formulation like 'c[0]/(x1+c[1])+c[2]' because it would be very similar to the already suggested 'c[0]/(x1+c[1])+c[2]/(x1+c[3])'.\n\nLet's try to introduce multiplicative interactions between the operators and the term x1 to add diversity while still maintaining simplicity and accuracy. \n\nAlso, we have to make sure to propose equations with different forms, not only different coefficients, to increase the diversity of the options.",
