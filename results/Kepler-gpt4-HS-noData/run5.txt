  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the previously suggested equations and their complexity and mse scores, it's clear that there's a trade-off between complexity and accuracy. As the complexity increases, the mse decreases, meaning the fit of the model to the data improves. However, for simplicity and ease of interpretation, we want to suggest equations that are less complex but still maintain a reasonable level of accuracy.\n\nConsidering the restrictions, the challenge of suggesting new equations involves thinking of mathematical transformations that haven't been used yet, and that are also allowed by the restrictions. For instance, the equations already include logarithmic (log), exponential (exp), square root (sqrt), and polynomial (square and cube) transformations. \n\nThe unary and binary operators are already used in various combinations across the previous equations. Therefore, it's vital to suggest diverse equations that haven't been represented yet. \n\nOne approach could be to combine these operations in different ways. For instance, adding or subtracting the results of different operations, or applying a unary operation to the result of a binary operation.\n\nGiven the nature of the data (planetary motion in astrophysics), it's also essential to consider the physical laws and principles that may apply. For example, Kepler's third law of planetary motion states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This suggests that a cubic relation between the semi-major axis (x1) and the period (y) could be a valid model.",
