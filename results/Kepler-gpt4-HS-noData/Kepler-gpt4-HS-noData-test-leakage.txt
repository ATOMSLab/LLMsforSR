In astrophysics, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This gives us a hint on the possible relationships between the independent variable x1 (semi-major axis) and the dependent variable y (period). 

Therefore, we can build our expressions around this law. We can start with the simplest form of Kepler's law, y = c0*x1^(3/2), and then derive two more complex expressions from the formula, such as y = c0*x1^3/c1 and y = c0*(x1/c1)^3....

Given that the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, Kepler's third law may provide some insight. This law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. The equation is P^2 = a^3 where P is the period and a is the semi-major axis. 

Keeping this law in mind, cubic and square relationships are the most relevant. The provided equations also show that cubic and square relationships have been explored. 

Taking the restrictions into account, we need to generate new equations that are not SR-similar to the ones provided. 

First equation:
One possible equation is to take the cube root of x1. This equation would have a complexity of 7 (1 for the unary operator, 3 for the variable, and 3 for the constant). This equation is not SR-similar to any of the provided equations.

New equation suggestions:
1. Try the square root of x1, since this operation has not been used alone yet. This gives a lower complexity expression.
2. Try the logarithm of x1, as this operation has not been used yet. This can capture exponential relationships and give a lower complexity expression.
3. Try cubing x1. This is inspired by Kepler's third law and can capture cubic relationships....

Looking at the provided Pareto front and restrictions, I can see that the functions with lower complexity yet higher mean square error (MSE) are using simple unary operations such as cube root and exponential, whereas functions with higher complexity have significantly lower MSE.

Here, MSE is a measure of how well the equation fits the data, with a lower value indicating a better fit. Complexity is a measure of how complicated the equation is, with a lower value indicating a simpler equation.

The data is about planetary motion in astrophysics where the independent variable (x1) is semi-major axis, and the dependent variable (y) is period in days. Based on Kepler's third law, there should be a proportional relationship between the cube of the semi-major axis and the square of the period.

Also, there's an equation in the list with a very low mse: 'c[0]*x1**(3/2)'. This suggests that a power of 3/2 could be a good fit for the data, and we should try to use it in some way in our new equations.

Looking at the given equations and their complexities and loss, we can see that as the complexity of the equation increases, the mean squared error (mse) decreases. This means that more complex equations fit the data better. However, our goal is to minimize both complexity and loss, so we want to find a balance between these two factors.

The equations provided are all power laws, which is consistent with Kepler's Third Law in astrophysics, stating that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

New equations should be diverse and not too similar to the existing ones. We need to ensure that the new equations are not SR-similar to the provided ones, meaning they are not equivalent after fitting constants to the data.

Following these guidelines, here are three suggested equations:

1. Using the square root function: c[0]*sqrt(x1)
2. Introducing a division operation: c[0]/x1
3. Using the exponential function: c[0]*exp(x1)...

Looking at the pareto front, we can see that the model with the lowest mse and lowest complexity is 'c[0]*x1'. This is a linear equation suggesting a direct relationship between x1 and the target variable. 

However, the data is related to planetary motion in astrophysics. Kepler's laws of planetary motion suggest a relationship between the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit (x1) and its period in days (y) that is not linear. Specifically, the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. 

This suggests that a better model would involve x1 raised to a power of 1.5 (which is the cube root of the cube of x1) or 2/3 (which is the square root of the cube of x1). 

Such models are not present in the pareto front. To generate new models, we will look at equations involving these exponents. 

We will also look at models involving the square of x1, as the pareto front suggests that these models have lower mse.

Given the restrictions, we will propose the following three models:

1. c[0]*x1^(2/3) - This is a simple model that directly applies Kepler's third law. 
2. c[0]*sqrt(x1^3) - This model is equivalent to the first model, but uses the sqrt operator instead of a fractional exponent.

The current best equation with the lowest complexity and lowest MSE is 'c[0]*x1**(3/2)' with a complexity of 7 and MSE of 46.68860689. However, the goal is to propose 3 new equations that further minimize both complexity and loss, ensuring they are not SR-similar to the existing ones.

Looking at the data's context, it's about planetary motion where the independent variable is the semi-major axis and the dependent variable is the period in days. Kepler's third law relates these two variables approximately as the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. This gives a hint to the kind of relations that might be present in the data.

1. The first new expression can be a slight modification of the best one by making it a cube root instead of a square root, i.e., 'c[0]*x1**c1' where c1 is fitted to be 1/3 to satisfy the cube root condition.

2. The second new expression can be a logarithmic relation, i.e., 'c[0]*log(x1**c1)' where c1 can be fitted to any value and it's not SR-similar to the existing logarithmic expression.

3. The third new expression can be an exponential relation, i.e., 'c[0]*exp(x1/c1)', where dividing x1 by c1 would make it different from the existing exponential expression....

Looking at the dataset, I see that the relationships are mostly power laws, which is consistent with Kepler's laws of planetary motion. To diversify the results, I'll consider combinations of different unary operators and vary the exponent.

The suggestion 'c[0]*x1**c[1]' has the lowest mse but the complexity is medium. To simplify, I could try 'c[0]*x1**2' or 'c[0]*x1**3' but these are not diverse.

I notice there are no expressions with subtraction or division yet. I could also try using these operators to create new expressions. But considering the nature of the dataset (planetary motion), division or subtraction might not make physical sense.

Also, no equation uses log or exp. The expression 'c[0]*exp(x1)' has high mse, so exponential might not fit well. However, logarithm might be worth trying. For instance, 'c[0]*log(x1**2)' or 'c[0]*log(x1**3)'. But these are not diverse from 'c[0]*(log(x1))**(3/2)'.

Taking all this into consideration, my suggestions are:

1. 'c[0]*x1**2' - This is a simplification of 'c[0]*x1**c[1]' with lower complexity but likely higher mse.

      ...Looking at the existing Pareto front, the equation with the least mean squared error (mse) is 'c[0]/(x1**c[1])', with a complexity of 5, but it's not the simplest one. The simplest equation is 'c[0]*x1', with a complexity of 3, but its mse is significantly higher.

We are looking for equations that are both simpler and more accurate. In order to do this, we can experiment with different combinations of binary and unary operators on x1. Let's try to avoid SR-similar expressions, which are basically the same equations in different formats.

Given that the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics and the independent variable is semi-major axis, the dependent variable is period in days, we might want to consider Kepler's laws of planetary motion. According to Kepler's third law, the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. However, the cube operator is not allowed in this case.

Here are three potential equations that could fit the data, while remaining simple and diverse:

1. 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)'
2. 'c[0]/x1'
3. 'c[0]*log(x1)'

These three equations are diverse in terms of the operations used, and are not SR-similar to the existing equations in the Pareto front. However, their fitness will need to be tested against the actual data....

The error drops significantly when we move from linear to polynomial or exponential forms, indicating that the underlying relationship is likely non-linear. 

In astrophysics, especially considering planetary motion, Kepler's laws of planetary motion suggest a relationship of the form T = k*(r^3/2), where T is the period and r is the semi-major axis. This is consistent with the equations with lower MSE in the Pareto front.

Considering all these factors, I will suggest three new equations that are diverse, not SR-similar to the existing ones, comply with the allowed operations, and align with the knowledge from Kepler's laws....

Given that the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, there's a well-known empirical law in astronomy known as Kepler's Third Law. This states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. 

Therefore, the three expressions could be:
1. A direct application of Kepler's Third Law, y = c0*x1^1.5

The dataset is about planetary motion in astrophysics. The previous equations indicate a relationship in which the period (y) scales as a function of the semi-major axis (x1). The Kepler's third law states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Therefore, the cube of x1 (x1**3) or square of x1 (x1**2) might be involved in the equation. 

Let's propose three new equations that fit the constraints:

1. The first equation is a direct application of Kepler's third law, with y = c[0]*(x1**3). This equation has a complexity of 4.

2. The second equation is a variation of Kepler's law, with y = sqrt(c[0]*x1). This equation also has a complexity of 4.

- To find new equations, I should consider the restrictions and try to balance mse and complexity.

- I can use different combinations of the unary and binary operators allowed to come up with new equations.

For the new suggestions, we want to ensure diversity and simplicity while maintaining good fit to the data. 

Given the data is about planetary motion, Kepler's third law suggests a cubic relation between the semi-major axis and period, so polynomials could be a good fit. However, we already have a polynomial in our Pareto front. 

Therefore, we should try different combinations of unary and binary operations to create fitting equations.

Considering the restrictions, the challenge of suggesting new equations involves thinking of mathematical transformations that haven't been used yet, and that are also allowed by the restrictions. For instance, the equations already include logarithmic (log), exponential (exp), square root (sqrt), and polynomial (square and cube) transformations. 

The unary and binary operators are already used in various combinations across the previous equations. Therefore, it's vital to suggest diverse equations that haven't been represented yet. 

One approach could be to combine these operations in different ways. For instance, adding or subtracting the results of different operations, or applying a unary operation to the result of a binary operation.

Given the nature of the data (planetary motion in astrophysics), it's also essential to consider the physical laws and principles that may apply. For example, Kepler's third law of planetary motion states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This suggests that a cubic relation between the semi-major axis (x1) and the period (y) could be a valid model....
