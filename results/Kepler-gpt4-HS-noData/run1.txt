  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe given dataset deals with a classic problem in astrophysics, which is about the correlation between the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit (x1) and the period of the planet's orbit (y).\n\nLooking at the dataset, it appears that the relationship between x1 and y is non-linear and more complex than a simple power law. This is evidenced by the fact that the mean squared error (MSE) decreases as the complexity of the equation increases.\n\nGiven the constraints, we need to find diverse equations that are not SR-similar to the ones already suggested. The already suggested equations are:\n1. c[0]*cbrt(x1)\n2. c[0]*exp(x1)\n3. c[0]*(x1)**2\n4. c[0]*log(x1)*x1\n5. c[0]*x1**(3/2)\n\nThe new equations should respect the constraints and be diverse from the already suggested equations. They should also minimize both complexity and loss. \n\nLet's propose some equations that follow these requirements and are diverse:\n\n1. c[0]*sqrt(x1)\n2. c[0]*log(x1)\n3. c[0]*x1/(log(x1))",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided Pareto front, we can notice that the expressions with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) are also ones with relatively high complexity. Moreover, since the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, we can apply Kepler's third law which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This can guide us in formulating new expressions.\n\nKeeping the above in mind, along with the restrictions provided, I will propose three new expressions that aim to minimize both complexity and MSE.
