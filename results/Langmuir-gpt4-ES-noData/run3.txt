  "LLM Thoughts": "In the provided dataset, the complexity and mean square error (mse) of each equation are inversely proportional.

However, we are also seeking to minimize complexity. \n\nFrom the provided equations, the one with the highest complexity (15) and lowest mse (1.59932971) is 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2+c[2]*x1**3'. The equation with the lowest complexity (3) and highest mse (87.90236102) is 'c[0]*x1'. \n\nThe equation 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' stands out as it has a relatively low complexity (7) and very low mse (0.12263081). This indicates a good balance between complexity and accuracy.\n\nConsidering the restrictions and the aim to minimize both complexity and mse, I propose the following three equations:\n\n1. A simple linear equation with a negative coefficient: '-c[0]*x1'. This equation has low complexity, but its mse will likely be higher due to its simplicity.\n2. A quadratic equation without a linear term: 'c[0]*x1**2'. This equation is slightly more complex, but should provide a better fit to the data.\n3. A reciprocal equation with a quadratic term in the denominator: 'c[0]/(c[1]*x1**2)'. This equation has a higher complexity and should provide a good fit to the data, especially if the relationship is non-linear.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions based on the given dataset and restrictions.
