Looking at the provided Pareto front, the 'mse' value decreases with the increasing complexity of the equation. The goal is to suggest three new equations that minimize both the complexity and the loss. The dataset is about nitrogen adsorbing onto mica and the only independent variable (x1) is pressure. 

The provided equations have complexity ranging from 3 to 11. To generate diverse equations that are not SR-similar, we can make changes in the operations and the arrangement of variables and constants. 

Also, since the data is about adsorption, it may follow either a Langmuir or a Freundlich adsorption isotherm, which are typically represented as linear relationships in logarithmic space. However, since logarithmic operations are not allowed, we will have to stick to polynomial-like relationships.

We should avoid using the same format as the existing equations to maintain diversity. For example, if an existing equation is 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**2', we should avoid suggesting 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**3' as it would be SR-similar. We should instead consider altering the arrangement of variables and constants, changing the operations, and introducing division where appropriate....

Given that this is about nitrogen adsorption and pressure (x1) as the independent variable, it's likely that the Langmuir isotherm or Freundlich isotherm models are applicable. Both are common in adsorption studies. 

The Langmuir isotherm model can be expressed as: y = (c0 * x1) / (1 + c1 * x1), where c0 is the maximum adsorption capacity and c1 is the Langmuir constant. 

The Freundlich isotherm model can be expressed as: y = c0 * x1^(1/c1), which is not allowed in this case as we're restricted to only basic operators.

However, we can try simplifying the Freundlich isotherm model expression to fit our requirement. We can consider y = c0 * x1/c1, but this is a simple linear model and might not fit well to the actual data.

Another possible model is a polynomial model, y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2. But since we're restricted to basic operators, we can simplify it to y = c0 + c1*x1 - c2/x1....
