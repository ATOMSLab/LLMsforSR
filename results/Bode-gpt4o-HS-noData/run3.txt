Given that the dataset is related to planetary systems and the semi-major axis, we might expect a relation similar to Kepler's laws, which involve squares and inverses. Thus, potential forms could involve powers and inverses.\n   \n2. A simple linear relation might be too naive, given the nature of planetary systems. An expression like c0 * x1^c1 might be a good starting point, as it can represent various power laws.\n\n3. Another possibility is an exponentially decaying or growing function, such as c0 * exp(c1 * x1), which could model rapid changes in semi-major axis with respect to the planet index.\n\n4. Since we aim for short equations, let's consider combinations of these types. For example, combining a power law and an exponential: c0 * x1^c1 + c2 * exp(c3 * x1).\n\n5. Given the restrictions, look for simple combinations that capture the general trend without overfitting. Consider the form c0 * x1^c1 + c2 for capturing both linear and non-linear trends.",

Currently, the simplest expression is \"c[0]+c[1]*x1\" with a complexity of 5 and an MSE of 33.77803354. We should consider expressions that are a bit more complex but significantly reduce MSE.\n2. The more complex expressions with lower MSE include exponential terms and rational functions. For example, \"c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)\" has a complexity of 6 and an MSE of 0.06324868.\n3. We have a constraint to not suggest SR-similar expressions. This means we need to consider structurally different forms that might still capture the underlying pattern.\n\nFrom the dataset and existing expressions, possible new expressions could involve:\n- Introducing a square root, exponential, or combination of polynomial and exponential terms, as long as they aren't SR-similar to existing ones.\n- Combining polynomial and exponential functions seems beneficial given the current Pareto front.\n- Using rational expressions that are different from \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)\" or similar forms.\n\nLet's explore some new forms:\n- A rational function that is different from those given: \"c0 / (c1 + x1^2)\"\n- A polynomial exponential combination: \"c0 * exp(x1) + c1 * x1^3\"\n- Consider using the inverse of exp: \"c0 / exp(c1 * x1) + c2 * x1\"\n\nThese suggestions aim to explore regions of the solution space that might capture the data's behavior while being diverse and not SR-similar.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nWe are given a set of existing equations with their complexities and mean squared errors (MSE). The goal is to suggest new equations that minimize both complexity and MSE, while being diverse and not SR-similar to the existing ones. Let's analyze some of the existing entries to identify patterns and opportunities for new equations:\n\n1. Existing Equations Analysis:\n   - Linear and simple rational forms: 'c[0]+c[1]*x1', 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)', etc.\n   - Exponential components: 'c[0]*exp(x1)+c[1]*x1', 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)', etc.\n   - More complex rational forms: 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1+c[2])', 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1**2+c[2])', etc.\n   - Combinations of exponential and rational forms: 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]/(c[3]+x1)', etc.\n\n2. Observations:\n   - The lowest complexity equations have higher MSE, suggesting a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy.\n   - Exponential terms seem to improve the MSE significantly, especially when combined with rational components.\n   - Rational expressions with quadratic terms (e.g., x1^2) also appear to be effective.\n\n3. Strategy for New Expressions:\n   - Consider using exponential terms with different combinations, e.g., multiplied by a rational component.\n   - Explore rational expressions with quadratic terms in the numerator or denominator.\n   - Aim for diversity by mixing these components in ways not already present in the dataset.\n\n4. Potential New Equations:\n   - Try mixing exponential growth with rational decay.\n   - Consider quadratic forms in both numerator and denominator for balance.\n   - Use the exponential function in novel ways, like in the exponent of a rational base.",
