A common pattern in planetary systems is the Titius-Bode law, which suggests a geometric progression. This could be modeled using exponential functions or power laws.\n3. Simple scaling expressions like y = c0 * x1 or y = c0 * x1 + c1 might serve as a baseline to understand initial linear relationships.\n4. Since exponential growth could be present, an expression like y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1) could be relevant.\n5. Considering the possibility of a power law, an expression like y = c0 * x1^c1 might capture the geometric progression in a more suitable way.\n6. The dataset's simplicity requires that expressions should not be overly complex, while still capturing potential exponential or power relationships.\n\nBased on these considerations, three potential expressions are constructed. These aim to balance complexity and projection accuracy while adhering to the given restrictions.",

We should aim to minimize complexity while striving for a lower MSE compared to existing options.\n\n5. To avoid SR-similar expressions, we should consider different mathematical structures or combinations that aren't simply variations of existing equations.\n\n6. We should focus on using the exponential operator creatively due to its success in prior equations.\n\n7. A potential strategy is to introduce new combinations of operators that haven't been explored yet, like combinations of polynomial and exponential terms or a different form of rational equations.\n\n8.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The current Pareto front suggests that simple linear and polynomial expressions with lower complexity have higher MSE values, indicating they may not capture the underlying pattern well enough.\n\n2. The expression 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' with complexity 6 and MSE 0.06324868 is a simple exponential model that performs quite well. We can explore variations of exponential functions to maintain simplicity while minimizing MSE.\n\n3. The equation with the lowest MSE, 'c[0]/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*exp(c[3]*x1)', has several components, suggesting a combination of rational and exponential functions is effective. We can try to simplify it while keeping the essence.\n\n4. The equation 'c[0]/(c[1]+exp(c[2]*x1))' is relatively simple but still performs well, indicating that rational functions with exponential terms are promising.\n\n5. To diversify suggestions, consider:\n   - Simple rational expressions with one or more exponential terms.\n   - Exponential decay or growth models with different forms.\n   - Combination of polynomial and exponential terms.",
