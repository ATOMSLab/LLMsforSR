      ...Scratch Pad:
1. The relationship we're analyzing is between the planet index (x1) and the semi-major axis (y).
2. A common pattern in planetary systems is the Titius-Bode law, which suggests a geometric progression. This could be modeled using exponential functions or power laws.
3. Simple scaling expressions like y = c0 * x1 or y = c0 * x1 + c1 might serve as a baseline to understand initial linear relationships.
4. Since exponential growth could be present, an expression like y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1) could be relevant.
5. Considering the possibility of a power law, an expression like y = c0 * x1^c1 might capture the geometric progression in a more suitable way.
6. The dataset's simplicity requires that expressions should not be overly complex, while still capturing potential exponential or power relationships.

Based on these considerations, three potential expressions are constructed. These aim to balance complexity and projection accuracy while adhering to the given restrictions....

      ...Scratch Pad:
1. The dataset involves semi-major axes of planets, which often follow a pattern similar to Titius-Bode law, which suggests semi-major axes grow approximately as a geometric sequence or exponential function.
2. Common expressions for planetary semi-major axes could involve exponential growth or power laws based on the planet index (x1).
3. Simpler expressions might involve linear or polynomial relationships, but given the nature of planetary systems, exponential or power expressions are more common.
4. Possible forms to consider:
   - Exponential: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)
   - Power law: y = c0 * x1 ^ c1
   - Linear: y = c0 * x1 + c1...
