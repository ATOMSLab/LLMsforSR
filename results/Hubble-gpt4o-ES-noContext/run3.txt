The goal is to achieve lower MSE with reasonable complexity.\n\nLet's consider the following strategies:\n- Use combinations of terms: linear, quadratic, cubic, and rational functions.\n- Avoid redundancy by not suggesting SR-similar expressions.\n\nPotential new expressions:\n1. A rational function with a quadratic numerator and a linear denominator.\n2. A linear combination of x1 and a rational function.\n3. A quadratic function with a linear correction factor.\n\nPossible candidates:\n1. `(c0*x1**2 + c1*x1 + c2) / (c3*x1 + c4)`\n2. `c0*x1 + c1/(x1 + c2)`\n3. `c0 + c1*x1**2 - c2*x1/(c3 + x1)`\n\nThese proposals are distinct from the existing equations and aim to achieve a good complexity-MSE trade-off.",
