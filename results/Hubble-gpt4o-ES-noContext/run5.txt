Start with linear and quadratic components and consider adding rational expressions:\n   - The simplest form is a linear function of x1; however, it has high mse and low complexity.\n   - Quadratic or rational expressions have been used, showing better mse.\n\n2. A combination of linear and rational components could be beneficial. The expression:\n   - \"c[0] * x1 + c[1] / (c[2] + x1)\" introduces a new rational component distinct from the dataset's most complex equation.\n\n3. Consider combining quadratic and rational components:\n   - \"c[0] * x1**2 / (c[1] + x1)\" adds a twist by placing the quadratic term in the numerator. This is distinct from the current dataset.\n\n4. Explore a simple rational expression:\n   - \"c[0] / (c[1] + x1)\" is a basic rational expression not directly present in the dataset.\n\n5. Another variant can be a combination of linear and quadratic forms:\n   - \"c[0] * x1 + c[1] * x1**2\" is already present but can be slightly adjusted to \"c[0] * x1**2 + c[1] / x1\" for diversity.",
