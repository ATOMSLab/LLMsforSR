The data doesn't seem to follow a simple linear trend.\n\n2. The dependent variable y has relatively large values compared to the independent variable x1, which ranges from 0.032 to around 2. This suggests that y could be a polynomial function of x1.\n\n3. A simple polynomial like y = c0 * x1 + c1 might not capture the non-linear peaks. We need to consider higher-order terms.\n\n4. A quadratic expression y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 might capture some of the curvature, but given the dataset's apparent complexity, a cubic term could be more fitting.\n\n5. A cubic polynomial: y = c0 * x1^3 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1 might be a good candidate. This allows for one inflection point, which could help mimic the dataset's shape.\n\n6. Considering the dataset's peaks and troughs, let's also try a rational expression: y = (c0 * x1 + c1) / (c2 * x1 + c3). This form can capture more complex behaviors, such as asymptotic or saturation effects.\n\n7. Linear combinations of non-linear terms might also work, such as y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1^3.\n\n8. Lastly, let's consider a simple rational form like y = c0 / x1 + c1, which can capture the inverse relationship, though it might not fit all data points.",

To suggest diverse expressions, we should consider variations on these forms, perhaps varying the polynomial degree or the structure of the fractions.\n3. One strategy could be to try combinations of different polynomial degrees or forms that might capture some different aspect of the data.\n4. Consider exploring lower or higher degree polynomials compared to what's already been used, or rational expressions that might capture non-linear behavior but remain different from previous attempts.\n5.

I need to generate new equations that differ structurally from these forms while ensuring reduced complexity and loss.\n\n2. The dataset suggests both increasing and decreasing trends in y against x1, possibly hinting at polynomial or rational relationships.\n\n3. To avoid SR-similar expressions, I should focus on distinct combinations of operators and structures:\n   - Consider simpler rational functions.\n   - Explore variations of linear combinations with inverses or multipliers.\n   - Use polynomials with a twist, like dividing by x1 or using different degrees.\n\n4. Let's derive three diverse expressions:\n   - A simple rational expression different from the given ones.\n   - A polynomial structure not covered by the previous suggestions.\n   - A combination of linear and inverse terms with unique structuring.\n\n5. Possible new expressions:\n   - Rational form with different structure: \"c0 / (x1 + c1*x1)\"\n   - Polynomial with a radical twist: \"c0 * x1**2 + c1 / x1\"\n   - Unique linear-inverse combination: \"c0 * x1 + c1 * x1 / (x1 + c2)\"",
