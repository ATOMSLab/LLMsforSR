Consider the dataset and existing expressions:\n   - The dataset suggests a non-linear relationship between y and x1, likely involving logarithmic or inverse functions.\n   - The existing expressions already use a variety of transformations, such as logarithm, square root, and powers of x1.\n\n3. Generate new suggestions:\n   - Seek diversity in functional forms that could further lower MSE while not increasing complexity excessively.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions by ensuring distinct functional forms.\n\n4. New expressions should balance complexity and loss:\n   - Consider combining logarithmic and polynomial terms differently.\n   - Consider using different arrangements of inverse and power terms.\n\nSuggestions:\n- c0 * (x1**-0.5) + c1*x1: Combining a power term with a linear term could capture non-linearity more effectively.\n- c0 * log(x1) + c1/x1**0.5: A combination of logarithmic and inverse square root terms might capture the adsorption process well.\n- c0 * x1**0.5 + c1 * x1**-1: Using a square root alongside an inverse term might offer a new perspective.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nTo generate new expressions, let's first analyze the pattern in the given dataset and the current Pareto front equations. The dataset provides a relationship between pressure (x1) and loading (y), with pressure decreasing and loading decreasing, suggesting a possible inverse relationship. \n\nThe current Pareto front equations involve various combinations of x1 with logarithmic, exponential, square root, and power transformations. The lowest complexity with acceptable mse is \"c[0]*log(x1)\" with a complexity of 4 and mse of 1.62182475.\n\nWe need to propose new expressions that are not SR-similar to the existing ones. This means we should avoid expressions that only differ by absorbing constants, signs, or are simple rearrangements of the existing expressions. We should aim for diversity in terms of mathematical transformations applied to x1.\n\n1. Consider using a combination of different unary operators not extensively used in the current set, such as square or cube, combined with logarithmic transformations.\n2. Explore expressions involving subtraction or division, as these binary operators have been less represented.\n3. Focus on simplicity to maintain low complexity while exploring new transformation combinations.\n\nPotential new expressions could include:\n\n1. An expression involving the square of x1 combined with a logarithmic term.\n2. A division-based expression with a novel combination of x1 and log(x1).\n3.
