  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n1. Looking at the dataset, the relationship between x1 and y appears to be decreasing non-linearly.\n2. As x1 increases, y decreases, suggesting a negative correlation.\n3. The decrease in y seems to slow down as x1 increases, which might suggest a logarithmic or inverse relationship.\n4. A simple inverse relationship like y = c0 / x1 might capture the general trend.\n5. Since the decrease is not strictly inverse, perhaps a transformation or combination of transformations may better capture the behavior.\n6. Consider using a logarithmic transformation: y = c0 * log(x1), but this does not fit the trend of decreasing y with increasing x1.\n7. Try using the square root or cube root to see if it captures the slow decrease. Maybe y = c0 / sqrt(x1) or y = c0 / x1^2.\n8. Analyze combinations such as y = c0 / (x1 + c1).\n9. We should also consider polynomial or power-law expressions like y = c0 * x1^c1.\n10. Consider expressions like y = c0 - c1 * x1, which is a simple linear model but may not fit well due to non-linearity.\n11. Looking for three potential expressions that can capture the behavior.",

Previous equations have shown utility in using inverse relationships, but we should avoid SR-similar expressions.\n\n2. From previous suggestions, expressions like `c[0]/x1` and `c[0]/(x1+c[1])` utilize inverse relationships but have relatively higher mean squared errors (MSE). The power expression `c[0]*x1**c[1]` yielded a notably lower MSE, indicating a better fit.\n\n3. To diversify, we can explore expressions involving different combinations of operations and functions. For instance, a combination of power or logarithmic transformation might yield a different perspective.\n\n4. Potential equation forms to consider:\n   - Incorporating a square or cube transformation: `c[0] * x1**2 + c[1]`, which can change the MSE.\n   - Utilizing logarithmic transformation: `c[0] * log(x1) + c[1]`, which might help linearize the relationship.\n   - Square root transformation: `c[0] * sqrt(x1) + c[1]`, which can also yield a nonlinear fit.\n\n5.
