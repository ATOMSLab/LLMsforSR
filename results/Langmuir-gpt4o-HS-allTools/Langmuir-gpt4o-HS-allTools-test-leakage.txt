      ...Scratch Pad:

1. **Dataset Analysis**:
   - Dependent variable `y` decreases as `x1` decreases, indicating an inverse 
  relationship possibly.
  - The data might follow a common adsorption isotherm model like Langmuir or Freundlich, which usually exhibit 
  logarithmic or inverse relationships.

2. **Previous Equations**:
   - Variety of forms including linear, polynomial, logarithmic, 
  and inverse relationships.
   
  - Complexity ranges from 5 to 11, and MSE ranges from 11.1 to 0.168.

3. **Objective**:
   
  - Minimize both MSE and complexity while ensuring expressions are diverse and not SR-similar to existing ones.

4. 
  **Potential New Equations**:
   - Consider simple inverse, exponential, or power law relationships.
   
  - Avoid redundancy by exploring new functional forms or combinations.

5. **Constraints**:
   - Use only specified operators and functions.
   
  - Ensure expressions are not SR-similar to each other or previous suggestions.

6. 
  **Formulation**:
   - Consider a simple exponential decrease: `c[0]*exp(-c[1]*x1)`
   
  - Consider a power-law relationship: `c[0]*x1**-c[1]`
   
  - Consider a combination of inverse and logarithmic: `c[0]/x1 + c[1]*log(x1)`...

      ...Scratch Pad:

1. Analyze the dataset:
   - The dependent variable, y, decreases as x1 decreases.
   - This suggests a possible inverse or logarithmic relationship.
   - The dataset is related to adsorption, which often follows Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms. 

2. Review existing equations:
   - The equations range in complexity from 5 to 11.
   - Lower complexity equations with moderate MSE include 'c[0]/x1+c[1]' and 'c[0]*x1**-c[1]'.
   - Logarithmic forms like 'c[0]*log(x1)+c[1]' exhibit lower MSE values, indicating a good fit.
   - Equations involving log(x1) tend to have lower MSEs, suggesting a logarithmic relationship.

3. Generate new expressions:
   - Aim to generate diverse expressions that balance complexity and low MSE.
   - Consider simple forms with logarithmic or inverse relationships.
   - Ensure new expressions are not SR-similar to existing ones.

4. Proposed new expressions:
   - 'c[0]/(x1**2) + c[1]' - A simple inverse square relationship.
   - 'c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*log(x1)' - Combines square root and logarithmic elements.
   - 'c[0]*exp(-x1) + c[1]' - An exponential decay form, differing from existing expressions....
