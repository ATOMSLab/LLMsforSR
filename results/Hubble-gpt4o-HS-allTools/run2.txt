  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Initial Observation:**\n    
  - The dataset is related to physical cosmology, specifically the speed of separation of a galaxy as a function of its proper distance. 
  This hints at potentially using models related to Hubble's Law or other cosmological distance-velocity relations.\n    
  - The data indicates non-linear behavior, as seen from the jumps and decreases in 'y' with respect to 'x1'.\n\n2. 
  **Data Characteristics:**\n    
  - The dataset contains a mix of increasing and decreasing values of 'y', as 'x1' increases, suggesting the possibility of polynomial or 
  exponential relationships.\n    - Certain sections of the data show a rapid increase in 'y' with a smaller increase in 'x1', suggesting 
  exponential growth might be relevant.\n\n3. 
  **Potential Models:**\n    
  - **Linear models**: y = c0 * x1 + c1\n        - Not suitable due to non-linear nature.\n    
  - **Polynomial models**: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2\n        - Could explain quadratic behavior seen in some sections.\n    
  - **Exponential models**: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)\n         - Can explain rapid increases in 'y'.\n    
  - **Logarithmic models**: y = c0 * log(c1 * x1)\n        - Could explain diminishing returns effect as 'x1' increases.\n\n4. 
  **Constraints:**\n    
  - Use of constants (c0, c1, etc.) is encouraged for flexibility without overfitting.\n    
  - Focus on simplicity: aim for shorter expressions that capture the overall trend rather than overfitting to noise.\n\n5. 
  **Candidate Expressions:**\n    
   - **Expression 1 (Polynomial):** y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1\n        - Captures basic quadratic behavior.\n   
   - **Expression 2 (Exponential):** y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)\n        - Captures rapid increases at certain ranges.\n    
   - **Expression 3 (Logarithmic):** y = c0 * log(c1 * x1 + 1)\n       - Avoids log(0) issue and models diminishing returns.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the dataset and previous suggestions, we need to develop new equations that strike a balance between complexity and mean squared error (MSE). The previous equations had complexities ranging from 6 to 13 and MSEs ranging from 27409 to 44078. We need to improve upon these while ensuring diversity in the equations.\n\nObservations:\n1. The dataset appears to have a non-linear relationship, potentially polynomial or exponential in nature.\n2. Previous expressions have used combinations of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithmic terms.\n3. Current best MSE is around 27239 with a complexity of 13.\n\nPotential New Forms:\n- We can try to create a lower complexity fit using combinations not previously explored, such as using division or different polynomial degrees.\n- Consider using a combination of sqrt or log with polynomial terms for diversity.\n- Try to leverage the inherent properties of the data, which may involve exponential growth behaviors, but also consider simpler polynomial approximations.\n\n1. Using sqrt and polynomial:\n   - c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1 * x1\n\n2. Using a different polynomial degree and combination:\n   - c0 * x1**3 + c1 * x1**2\n\n3. Using division for potential improvement:\n   - c0 / (x1 + c1)\n\nThese suggestions aim to maintain a balance between lower complexity and MSE while introducing different functional forms.",
