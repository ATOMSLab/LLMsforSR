The goal is to model this relationship using simple mathematical expressions. The structure of the data suggests a potentially non-linear relationship with significant variations, possibly due to the effects of cosmic expansion.\n\n1. Observation: At small x1, the values of y fluctuate significantly, but as x1 increases, y seems to increase, indicating a potentially exponential or polynomial relationship.\n\n2. Polynomials: Given the variability and rapid increase in y, a polynomial relationship could be appropriate. We should consider quadratic or cubic terms involving x1.\n\n3. Exponential/Square Root: The rapid increase in y for higher values of x1 may also suggest an exponential or square root relationship, capturing the rapid growth behavior typical in gravitational and cosmological phenomena.\n\n4. Logarithmic: While a logarithmic model could capture slower growth, the rapid increase in y with x1 makes this less likely to be the primary model without additional terms.\n\nConsidering the above observations, the expressions will likely involve combinations of powers of x1 and potentially exponential terms.",
