Let's first observe the data patterns. The independent variable x1 seems to have a non-linear relationship 
  with the dependent variable y. Given the context of physical cosmology, it is likely that the relationship between the speed of separation and 
  the proper distance is non-linear.

Notably, the speed of separation (y) increases with the increase in the proper distance (x1), 
  which is consistent with concepts like Hubble's Law in cosmology where velocity is proportional to distance. However, the relationship might 
  not be perfectly linear due to other cosmological effects or observational anomalies.

Let's consider some common non-linear transformations:
  
1. Linear Relation: y = c0 * x1
2. 
  Quadratic Relation: y = c0 * x1^2
3. 
  Square Root Relation: y = c0 * sqrt(x1)
4. 
  Logarithmic Relation: y = c0 * log(x1)
5. 
  Exponential Relation: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)
  

We should also consider combinations of these transformations. The task is to find expressions that describe the dataset approximately. 
  We can try combinations like:
- Using square or cube functions for polynomial relationships.
- Using exponential or log functions 
  for more complex growth patterns.

Looking at the dataset, the rapid increase in y with x1 suggests trying polynomial relationships first, 
  such as quadratic or cubic, and possibly an exponential relationship due to the rapid increase at higher values.

Based on th...

1. **Initial Observation:**
    
  - The dataset is related to physical cosmology, specifically the speed of separation of a galaxy as a function of its proper distance. 
  This hints at potentially using models related to Hubble's Law or other cosmological distance-velocity relations.
    
  - The data indicates non-linear behavior, as seen from the jumps and decreases in 'y' with respect to 'x1'.

2. 
  **Data Characteristics:**
    
  - The dataset contains a mix of increasing and decreasing values of 'y', as 'x1' increases, suggesting the possibility of polynomial or 
  exponential relationships.
    - Certain sections of the data show a rapid increase in 'y' with a smaller increase in 'x1', suggesting 
  exponential growth might be relevant.

3. 
  **Potential Models:**
    
  - **Linear models**: y = c0 * x1 + c1
        - Not suitable due to non-linear nature.
    
  - **Polynomial models**: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2
        - Could explain quadratic behavior seen in some sections.
    
  - **Exponential models**: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)
         - Can explain rapid increases in 'y'.
    
  - **Logarithmic models**: y = c0 * log(c1 * x1)
        - Could explain diminishing returns effect as 'x1' increa...
