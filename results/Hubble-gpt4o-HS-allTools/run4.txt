The values of y suggest a possible quadratic or cubic relationship with x1, given the rapid increases and decreases.\n3. The values of x1 are small, often less than 2, which may mean that small changes in x1 can cause significant changes in y.\n4. The rapid oscillations and variation in y suggest that a polynomial or an exponential relationship may be suitable.\n5. Consider using a combination of polynomial and exponential functions to capture the behavior of the dataset.\n6.

Since we want to keep complexity low, trigonometric functions are not allowed.\n\n3.
