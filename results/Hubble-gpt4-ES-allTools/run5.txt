From the basic principles of cosmology, we can infer that the speed of separation of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This principle is known as Hubble's law and it can be expressed as v = H0 * D, where v is speed of separation, H0 is Hubble's constant, and D is the proper distance. Therefore, we can say y = c0 * x1. Also, considering the data, there might be some quadratic and cubic relationships as well. So, we can also consider y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 and y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1^3 as possible expressions.",

For example, the equation \"c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**4\" has a relatively low MSE (28464.25962065) and moderate complexity (9). We can combine this with the idea from the equation \"c[0]*x1+c[1]/x1\" (which has a lower complexity of 7) to create a new equation \"c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**3\".\n\nFinally, we can try to reduce the MSE by introducing new operations. For example, we can take the equation \"c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2+c[2]*x1**3\" (which has the lowest MSE of 26860.86455185 but a high complexity of 15) and introduce a division operation to create a new equation \"c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2/c[2]*x1**3\". This could potentially reduce the MSE further, while also reducing the complexity.",
