Given the context of the data, we can hypothesize that the rate of separation of the galaxy and its proper distance might follow Hubble's law, i.e., v = H * d, where v is the velocity of separation, d is the distance, and H is Hubble's constant. 

However, as the requirement forbids the fitting of constants, we will use c0 to represent Hubble's constant. Therefore, the first equation would be y = c0 * x1.

Additionally, we can try some polynomial expressions of x1, as the relationship might not be linear due to the effects of dark energy or other cosmological phenomena. So, the second equation could be y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2.

Lastly, we can add a third equation with a cubic term, which might better fit the data if there's a significant non-linearity. Therefore, the third equation would be y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1^3....

First, let's visualize the data and try to figure out the relationship between y and x1. 

Since the data is about physical cosmology, it seems that the data could follow Hubble's Law, which states that the speed of a galaxy (v) is proportional to its distance (d) from the observer. This can be represented as v = H*d, where H is Hubble's constant.

Given the restrictions, we could use a simple linear relationship of the form y = c0*x1, which aligns with Hubble's Law. 

But since there could be some non-linearity in the data, it would be good to consider a quadratic and a cubic expression as well, to capture any possible non-linear trends. These would be of the form y = c0*x1 + c1*x1^2 and y = c0*x1 + c1*x1^2 + c2*x1^3, respectively....

The dependent variable, y, is the speed of separation of a galaxy and the independent variable, x1, is the proper distance to that galaxy. The relationship between the speed of separation and distance to the galaxy suggests a linear relationship, given the context of Hubble's law in physical cosmology.

However, the data seems to have some non-linearity as well. Hence, we can propose a few forms of equations that could be fit to this data. The simplest would be a linear equation with the form c0*x1. To capture any non-linearity, we can also propose a quadratic equation with the form c0*x1^2 + c1*x1. Furthermore, we can propose a cubic equation with the form c0*x1^3 + c1*x1^2 + c2*x1....

Looking at the given Pareto front, it seems that the equations with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) are also the most complex ones, which is expected as they capture more of the non-linear behavior of the data.

The dataset represents a relationship between the proper distance to a galaxy (x1) and its speed of separation (y). According to Hubble's law in physical cosmology, the speed of separation between two galaxies is proportional to their distance. This suggests that a linear model may not be the best fit for this data.

To minimize complexity while also reducing loss, we should aim to use non-linear transformations of x1 that haven't been used in previous equations without increasing the complexity too much. We should also take into account the restrictions provided.

Proposed equations:

1. c[0]*x1**2/(c[1]+x1): This equation is a modification of the third equation in the Pareto front. It captures the non-linear relationship between x1 and y while only increasing the complexity by 2.

2. c[0]*x1**2+c[1]/x1: This equation introduces a division operation, which hasn't been used in the Pareto front apart from the third equation. It might capture a different aspect of the non-linearity.

3. c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2]: This equation is a simplified version of the fifth equation in the Pareto front. It reduces complexity by remo...

The data seems to follow an increasing pattern, which suggests a positive relationship between the variables. Since the data is related to physical cosmology, the data could likely follow Hubble's law, which states that the speed of separation of a galaxy is proportional to its distance. This would imply a linear relationship between the variables. 

Given the restrictions, the simplest model to start with would be a linear model of the form y = c0*x1. 

However, if the relationship is not exactly linear, we might need to include higher order terms. A quadratic equation can be considered, such as y = c0*x1 + c1*x1^2. 

A third equation to consider could be y = c0*x1 + c1/x1. This equation implies that the speed of separation increases with distance but at a decreasing rate....

The dataset represents a relationship between the proper distance to a galaxy (x1) and its speed of separation (y). From the basic principles of cosmology, we can infer that the speed of separation of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the observer. This principle is known as Hubble's law and it can be expressed as v = H0 * D, where v is speed of separation, H0 is Hubble's constant, and D is the proper distance. Therefore, we can say y = c0 * x1. Also, considering the data, there might be some quadratic and cubic relationships as well. So, we can also consider y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 and y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1^3 as possible expressions....

Given the restrictions, we can build on the previously suggested equations and propose additional ones that are diverse and yet not SR-similar. Since the previous equations only involve polynomial expressions, we can try to include division operations to diversify the equation forms. 

Also, as we are working with cosmology data, it's useful to consider that the Hubble's law (v = H0 * d) might be a good starting point for our equations. However, we can't include constants directly, so we will need to use the given c[0], c[1], etc. as stand-ins. We'll need to be careful not to create equations that are SR-similar to the existing ones.

Let's start with a simple equation that mimics Hubble's law using the allowed operators and variables.

1. c[0]*x1 is already present, and it's the simplest form that mimics Hubble's law.

To add complexity and potentially improve the fit, we can try variations of this equation:

2. c[0]*x1+c[1]/x1 might be a good option. This equation is not SR-similar to the existing ones, and it includes a division operation which can handle potential non-linear relationships in the data.

3. c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1**2) could offer a good balance between complexity and accuracy. This equation introduces a new form of interaction between variables.

4. c[0]*(x1**2)/c[1] might also be a good option. This equation is more complex and may capt...

      ...Looking at the dataset, the dependent variable (speed of separation) appears to increase as the independent variable (proper distance) increases. This is consistent with Hubble's law in cosmology, which states that the farther a galaxy is from the observer, the faster it moves away.

Reviewing the provided equations, the complexity increases with the increase in the number of terms and operators. Similarly, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) decreases as the complexity increases, indicating a better fit to the data with more complex equations.

Besides, it's clear that we need to find expressions with minimal complexity and loss. Considering the restrictions, I can suggest new expressions that involve mathematical operations on the independent variable x1 with constants. 

The expressions will be diverse, as requested, and will have different combinations of operators and terms. It's noteworthy that the suggested equations will not include complex unary operators (trigonometric functions or exponentials) and will not be SR-similar to the given equations....
