  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nObserving the given dataset, the relationship between x1 and y seems to be reciprocal. However, since we cannot suggest SR-similar expressions, we should avoid the reciprocal form directly. Instead, we can explore the logarithmic relationship, exponential relationship, and power relationship. \n\n1. Logarithmic relationship: Since the logarithm of x1 has already been used, we can try to use a different form of the logarithm, like the natural logarithm of the square root of x1.\n\n2. Exponential relationship: An exponential relationship would be of the form y = c0 * exp(x1). However, as the values of x1 are quite large and the y values are relatively small, we may need to adjust the x1 in the exponential function. We could try using the square root of x1 or the reciprocal of x1 in the exponential function.\n\n3. Power relationship: The power relationship y = x1^n is also a possible form. We have used square and square root in the previous suggested equations. We could try using a cube or cube root function.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the complexity and MSE of the previous equations, a pattern can be observed where the use of logarithmic and square root functions tend to result in lower MSE. However, the complexity increases with the inclusion of additional operations. We need to find a balance between complexity and accuracy. Additionally, we must ensure we are not suggesting SR-similar expressions to avoid redundancy.\n\nConsidering these factors, the following expressions may serve as potential candidates:\n\n1. sqrt(x1)*c[0]: This expression is simple with a complexity of 4 but incorporates the square root function which has shown to improve MSE in the past.\n2. exp(x1)*c[0]: This expression is also simple with a complexity of 4 and introduces the exponential function which might fit the data well.\n3.
