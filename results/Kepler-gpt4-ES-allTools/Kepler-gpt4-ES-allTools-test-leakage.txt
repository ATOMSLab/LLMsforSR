Given the information provided, this dataset seems to be related to Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

The given dataset represents planetary motion where the semi-major axis (x1) is the independent variable and the period in days (y) is the dependent variable. 

The provided equations that have been previously suggested are in the form of 'c[0]*x1**(n)' where n = 2.5, 2, or 1.5. These equations are power laws, which are often found in physics and other scientific disciplines.

Considering the domain knowledge in astrophysics, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This suggests a potential cubic relationship between x1 and y.

However, the use of unary operators is limited to the square root, and the power of 3 is not available. 

To meet the requirements of minimizing both complexity and loss, and to provide diverse equations, we need to explore variations of the provided equations, while keeping in mind the restriction of operators and the guidelines to avoid redundant expressions.

The current lowest MSE is achieved with the equation 'c[0]*x1**(1.5)', with a complexity of 5. To diversify the expressions, I will create some new equations with similar complexities but different structures that could potentially fit the data better.

1. The first expression I suggest is 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1', which is a simple linear combination of the independent variable with two different coefficients. This has a complexity of 8.

2. The second expression is 'sqrt(c[0]*x1)', which is a square root of the independent variable multiplied by a coefficient. This has a complexity of 4.

From the dataset, it is observed that as the semi-major axis (x1) increases, the period in days (y) also increases. This is consistent with Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Hence, it is expected that non-linear equations will provide a better fit for the data.

Given that the MSE decreases as complexity increases, it is necessary to find alternative equations that balance MSE and complexity. The provided equations are already diverse, ranging from simple division to the use of the sqrt() function and polynomial terms. 

Keeping in mind the restrictions and the requirement for diverse expressions, three new equations that could be suggested are:

1. A linear combination of sqrt(x1) and x1, which is different from the provided equations because it involves adding the two terms instead of multiplying them by constants. This equation is less complex than some of the provided equations, but might have a slightly higher MSE.

However, as per the problem constraints, only the operations +, -, *, /, and sqrt() are allowed, which limits the complexity of equations that can be produced.

Analysing the provided Pareto front of equations, it seems like the best performing equations involve the use of the sqrt() function and various multiplicative combinations of the variable x1. From this, it is evident that the data shows a non-linear relationship between x1 and y, and the expressions that incorporate sqrt() operation are performing well.

The given data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, which suggests Kepler's third law might be relevant. Kepler's third law states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This gives us a starting point for our symbolic regression.

We can observe that the mean squared error (mse) is decreasing as the complexity of the equation increases, but we want to balance complexity with accuracy. We also want to avoid SR-similar expressions, so we need to be careful not to suggest equations that can be simplified to the same form.

First, let's consider a simple equation that is similar to Kepler's third law but without squaring or cubing, since we're restricted to using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root. This gives us an equation of the form "c[0]*x1" which has a low complexity of 3 but high mse.

Therefore, the new equations should capture this relationship. 

Considering the constraints and avoiding SR-similar expressions, let's consider:

1. An expression that directly relates 'y' to the cube root of 'x1': 'c[0]*sqrt(x1**3)'. This equation is not only simple (complexity 5) but also reflects the underlying physics.

As the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics, where the independent variable (x1) is the semi-major axis, and the dependent variable (y) is the period in days, it's likely that the square root operator will be involved due to Kepler's third law of planetary motion.

Based on the restrictions that the only acceptable operators are +, -, *, /, and sqrt(), we generate three new expressions. These expressions are generated with the aim to minimize both complexity and loss, and to be diverse.

Taking into consideration the SR-similarity, we must ensure that the new expressions are not equivalent to the existing ones after fitting constants to data. For example, we should avoid forms that are similar to c0/x1, c0*x1, etc.

Observing the dataset, it appears to follow a power law, which is a common relationship in astrophysics. The period of a planet (y) is proportional to the semi-major axis (x1) raised to a power (typically ~1.5 in Kepler's laws). However, since we can only use the sqrt() function and not a general power function, we can manipulate this law as the square of the square root, which is equivalent to the first power, and the square of the square of the square root, which is equivalent to the second power.

The three expressions we'll consider are:

1) y = c0 * sqrt(x1)

One approach could be to use a power of 3/2, which is suggested by Kepler's third law. This would create an equation of the form c[0]*sqrt(x1)**3 which has a complexity of 5.

The equation 'c[0]*x1*x1', has a relatively lower error (MSE = 232415.8720769) and a complexity of 5. This indicates that the data might follow a quadratic function. 

Given the restrictions on the operators and the fact that we are dealing with planetary motion data where Kepler's third law suggests a power relation between the period and the semi-major axis, I am inclined towards power relations and their combinations.

I will suggest 3 equations that have not been tried before, keeping the complexity as low as possible and considering the nature of the data:
1. c[0]*x1*x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1)
2. c[0]*sqrt(x1*x1*x1)

Looking at the data, it appears to follow a pattern similar to Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This suggests a power relationship between the period (y) and the semi-major axis (x1).

From the Pareto front, we can see that there is a trend where equations with higher complexity tend to have a lower mean squared error (MSE). However, we are aiming for a balance between complexity and accuracy, so we need to find equations that are not overly complex but still accurately represent the data.

The equation with the lowest MSE is 'c[0]*sqrt(x1*x1*x1)+c[1]*x1', but it has a complexity of 12. A simpler equation with a slightly higher MSE is 'c[0]*x1*x1', which has a complexity of 5. However, this equation might be too simple to accurately represent the data.

To provide diverse equations, we should experiment with different combinations of the allowed operators.

      ...The given dataset seems to follow the Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This means that we can expect a power law relationship between the two variables. Given the restrictions on the operators, we can use *, / and sqrt() to form the expressions. 

Looking at the dataset, it seems like the dependent variable y can be represented as a simple multiplication of a constant c0 and the independent variable x1 raised to the power 1.5. This follows the Kepler's Third Law as the square root of y would be proportional to x1 cubed. 

Two alternative expressions could be a direct division of y by x1 or a division of y by the square root of x1. These expressions might not follow the Kepler's Third Law directly but they are based on simple mathematical transformations of the data using the allowed operators and can provide approximations of the relationship between the variables....

The relationship between the semi-major axis and the period in planetary motion is given by Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. So, the equations should follow a pattern where y ∝ x1^1.5.

The equations provided in the Pareto front show that the relationship is indeed a non-linear one with a power of 1.5. The minimum complexity is 3 and the minimum mean square error is 46.68860689.

However, these equations are quite complex. The challenge is to find expressions with lower complexity but still maintaining a low MSE. 

Considering the restrictions and the nature of the dataset (planetary motion in astrophysics), Kepler's Third Law could be a good starting point, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Therefore we can try expressions that involve the cube of x1 and the square of y. 

Also, we can experiment with the square root function since it was used in the expressions with the lowest MSE. However, we need to be careful not to create SR-similar expressions. 

Based on these considerations, I suggest the following expressions:

1. c[0]*x1**3: This is a simplified version of Kepler's Third Law, without the square on y. The complexity is 4, which is lower than the complexity of the expressions with the lowest MSE.
2. sqrt(c[0]*x1**3): This introduces the square root function, which was present in the expressions with the lowest MSE. The complexity is 5.

We observe that equations with higher complexity tend to perform better (lower MSE). However, we need to balance complexity with the performance. So, we will aim to find equations with relatively less complexity but better performance.

The new equations should be based on the formula of Kepler's law, which is T^2 = k*r^3 (T is the period, r is the semi-major axis and k is a proportionality constant). We can modify this equation in different ways to form new expressions.

Looking at the provided Pareto front analysis, there are some equations with low mean squared error (mse) and relatively low complexity.

The dataset represents a physical quantity (planetary motion) where the relationship is typically a power law. The independent variable (x1), semi-major axis, and the dependent variable (y), period in days, suggest a Kepler's third law relationship, which is a power of 1.5.

Given the constraints, we should try to come up with three new diverse equations that may fit the data better with lower complexity. The goal is to use simple operators (+, -, *, / and sqrt()) and the variable x1. We can explore different combinations of these operators with x1.

Based on the above analysis, I suggest the following new equations:

1. sqrt(c[0]*x1)*c[1] - This equation is a variation of the simplest equation in the Pareto front analysis. By introducing another constant, we may be able to better fit the data.

Looking at the existing equations, the most accurate equations (lowest mse) are also the most complex. The equations with the lowest complexity have high mse, indicating they are not fitting the data well. 

We need to find a balance between complexity and accuracy. Considering this, we can try the following new equations, which are diverse and fit the Kepler's law:

As these are astrophysics data, Kepler's third law might offer some insight. It states that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This gives us a hint for the form of potential equations.

1. A direct application of Kepler's third law would be c[0]*x1**1.5. However, this equation has already been suggested previously, so we need to make it diverse. By adding a constant term (c[1]), we can get a diverse equation.

2. Another way to create a diverse equation is to add two terms that are both functions of x1. For example, we could add a term that is linear in x1 to a term that includes the square root of x1.

3. Finally, we could try to create an equation that includes division, as this operator has not been used much in the best expressions so far. One possibility would be to divide one function of x1 by another....
