Looking at the dataset and the previous equations, it's clear that we need to balance complexity with accuracy. Since we're dealing with adsorption data, we could consider models that are typically used in this area like Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. However, the restrictions mentioned prohibit using exponentials which are part of Freundlich model. Therefore, we would focus on models similar to Langmuir that could be represented using the permitted operators.

1. A simple linear model is already provided: c[0]*x1. We can try a variation of this where we subtract x1 from a constant: c[0] - x1. This is a simple model and could potentially fit the data well.

2. A model that includes division is also already provided: (c[0]*x1)/(1+c[1]*x1). To provide a diverse model, we could consider a variation where we divide x1 by a constant: x1 / c[0]. This is also a simple model but introduces a division operation.

3. The previous models either add or subtract x1 from a constant, or divide x1 by a constant. For the third model, we could consider a model that multiplies x1 with a constant: c[0] * x1. This is another simple model that could potentially fit the data well....

Looking at the provided dataset, it appears that as the pressure (x1) increases, the loading (y) also increases. However, the rate of increase appears to slow down as the pressure increases, suggesting a possible logarithmic or saturation trend.

The proposed equations so far include linear terms, reciprocals, and combinations of these. To propose diverse equations, I can consider incorporating multiplicative interactions or more complex combinations of the variables.

However, I need to remember that the goal is to minimize complexity while maintaining accuracy. So, I should avoid overly complicated expressions.

Given the nature of the data (adsorption at constant temperature), the Langmuir isotherm or Freundlich isotherm equations could provide a good fit. However, these equations include exponentials, which are not allowed in this task. So, I need to stick with the allowable operators (+, -, *, /).

Proposed equations:
1. A variation of the Langmuir isotherm equation without the exponential: c0*x1/(1+c1*x1)
2. A similar equation but with a negative reciprocal: c0-c1/(x1+c2)
3. A combination of linear and reciprocal terms: c0*x1 + c1/(x1+c2)

These equations are diverse, and none of them are SR-similar to the ones already proposed....

      ...), it is evident that the MSEs tend to decrease as the complexity of the equations increase. However, the rate of decrease in MSE slows down, suggesting that we are reaching the point of diminishing returns in terms of complexity. 

The equations provided can be categorized into two types: polynomial types (i.e., equations of the form c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2) and rational types (i.e., equations of the form c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)). 

The polynomial types seem to be performing better, but they are also more complex. The rational types, while simpler, are not performing as well. Considering that we are looking for a balance between complexity and performance, it may be beneficial to consider a combination of the two types.

In addition, it is also important to consider the physical meaning of the data. The dependent variable represents the amount of isobutane adsorbed onto silicalite, while the independent variable represents the pressure. The adsorption of gases onto solids is often modeled using Langmuir isotherms, which are of the form a*x/(1+b*x), where x is the pressure and a and b are constants.

Considering all these factors, I suggest the following three equations:

1. A combination of polynomial and rational types: c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)
2. A quadratic equation: c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2
3. A Langmuir isotherm model: c[0]*x1/(1+c[1]*x1)...
