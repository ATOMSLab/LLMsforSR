However, the rate of decrease in MSE slows down, suggesting that we are reaching the point of diminishing returns in terms of complexity. \n\nThe equations provided can be categorized into two types: polynomial types (i.e., equations of the form c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2) and rational types (i.e., equations of the form c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)). \n\nThe polynomial types seem to be performing better, but they are also more complex. The rational types, while simpler, are not performing as well. Considering that we are looking for a balance between complexity and performance, it may be beneficial to consider a combination of the two types.\n\nIn addition, it is also important to consider the physical meaning of the data. The dependent variable represents the amount of isobutane adsorbed onto silicalite, while the independent variable represents the pressure. The adsorption of gases onto solids is often modeled using Langmuir isotherms, which are of the form a*x/(1+b*x), where x is the pressure and a and b are constants.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I suggest the following three equations:\n\n1.

The equations 'c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)' and 'c[0]+c[1]/(x1+c[2])' have the same complexity and nearly the same mse, but they are not SR-similar because the fitted constants c[1] and c[2] cannot be consolidated. \n\nWe should keep these factors in mind while proposing the new equations.",

Therefore, we need to come up with diverse equations that are not SR-similar to the provided ones.\n\nLooking at the data, it seems that the dependent variable y increases as x1 increases, but at a decreasing rate. This suggests a logarithmic or a square root relationship. However, since only four operators (+, -, *, /) are allowed, we cannot directly use these functions. Instead, we can try to mimic their behavior using only these operators.\n\nHere are some possible equations:\n\n1. c0 + c1*x1 + c2/(x1 + c3) - This equation includes the effects of x1, both linearly and inversely. The inverse term may mimic the decreasing rate of increase in y as x1 increases.\n\n2. c0 + c1*(x1**2) + c2/(x1 + c3) - This equation is similar to the previous one but includes a quadratic term.

A model where x1 is divided by a constant plus the square of x1. This equation will allow the model to capture potential diminishing returns as x1 increases.\n\n3.

The expressions mostly include linear terms (x1), quadratic terms (x1**2), and rational terms involving division by x1 or a combination of constant and x1. \n\nThe provided dataset comprises isobutane adsorption onto silicalite at a constant temperature. The independent variable is pressure (x1), and the dependent variable is loading (y). Given the nature of adsorption, and the constraints on the mathematical operations used in the expression, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the relationship could be expressed in forms of linear, quadratic, or rational functions of pressure.\n\nFor the new expressions, we aim to provide diverse expressions with different structures while taking into account the balance between complexity and mse.
