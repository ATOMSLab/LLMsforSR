  planetary system with their index as the independent variable. Since planetary orbits tend to 
  follow certain patterns, such as those described by Kepler's laws, the expressions might involve 
  inverse square laws or other polynomial forms.\n\n1. Linear relationships (e.g., y = c0 * x1 + c1) are typically a starting point but may not capture the non-linear nature of planetary distributions.\n2. Quadratic or cubic relationships (e.g., y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2) might capture more of the curvature typically seen in planetary systems.\n3. Logarithmic relationships (e.g., y = c0 * log(x1) + c1) could reflect how spacing between planets might scale.\n4. Exponential relationships (e.g., y = c0 * exp(x1) + c1) may be too extreme unless dampened by other terms.\n5. Since we can't include constants directly, we'll express them as c0, c1, etc., and focus on finding patterns based on x1.\n\nConsidering these possibilities, let's consider:\n- y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1: Square root captures non-linear growth.\n- y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1: Quadratic relationships can capture polynomial trends.\n- y = c0 * log(x1) + c1: Logarithmic can capture diminishing returns in spacing.",
