      ...Scratch Pad:
The dataset represents the semi-major axis of planets in a 
  planetary system with their index as the independent variable. Since planetary orbits tend to 
  follow certain patterns, such as those described by Kepler's laws, the expressions might involve 
  inverse square laws or other polynomial forms.

1. Linear relationships (e.g., y = c0 * x1 + c1) are typically a starting point but may not capture the non-linear nature of planetary distributions.
2. Quadratic or cubic relationships (e.g., y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2) might capture more of the curvature typically seen in planetary systems.
3. Logarithmic relationships (e.g., y = c0 * log(x1) + c1) could reflect how spacing between planets might scale.
4. Exponential relationships (e.g., y = c0 * exp(x1) + c1) may be too extreme unless dampened by other terms.
5. Since we can't include constants directly, we'll express them as c0, c1, etc., and focus on finding patterns based on x1.

Considering these possibilities, let's consider:
- y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1: Square root captures non-linear growth.
- y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1: Quadratic relationships can capture polynomial trends.
- y = c0 * log(x1) + c1: Logarithmic can capture diminishing return...

      ...Scratch Pad:

- We have a set of candidate equations with varying complexities 
  and mean square errors (mse).
- Our goal is to suggest new equations that have low complexity and 
  low mse, ideally improving on the existing ones.
- We need to avoid SR-similar equations, 
  which means looking for structurally different expressions.
- The data involves the semi-major 
  axis of planetary systems, so we might expect relationships involving powers or roots, 
  as gravitational dynamics often involve squares or inverses.

1. 
  Current best equation in terms of mse is `c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1` with mse = 11296.31 and 
  complexity = 9.
2. We have seen equations involving square roots, cubes, and third roots, 
  which might reflect Kepler's laws or similar astronomical relationships.
  

Ideas for new equations:
- c0 * log(x1) + c1 * x1: Logarithmic relationships could 
  capture some non-linear scaling.
- c0 * exp(x1) + c1: Exponential functions could model rapid 
  increases or decreases.
- c0 / x1 + c1 * sqrt(x1): A combination of inverse and square root to 
  capture different scaling behaviors.

These suggestions aim to provide diverse mathematical 
  behaviors while keeping complexity reasonable....

      ...Scratch Pad:
1. The dataset revolves around the semi-major axis of a planetary system, 
  which often follows Kepler's third law that relates the periods of planets to their semi-major axes. 
  This might translate to a power law relationship in a simple form.
2. Given the restriction to use 
  expressions without fitting constants directly, we can assume c0, c1, etc., represent constants 
  that would be determined through fitting.
3. A common approach is to start with polynomial 
  expressions or transformations such as logarithms or exponential functions.
4. Considering the 
  nature of planetary systems, an expression like c0 * x1^c1 could be a starting point, 
  where semi-major axis is proportional to some power of the planet index.
5. 
  Logarithmic or square root transformations might capture relationships where the rate of change decreases with increasing x1.
6. Exponential functions could model rapid increases or decreases....
