A potential simple model could be a polynomial, but given the constraints, let's consider forms like a*x1 + b or a*x1 - b, etc., where a and b could be constants like c0, c1.\n\n3. Another approach is to try inverse or reciprocal terms since the initial part of the data is small, and inverses can yield such behavior. Forms like c0/x1 or c0/(x1+c1) can be explored.\n\n4.

There are multiple inflection points, suggesting a rational or logarithmic component could capture this relationship well.\n\n- Given the constraints, we can consider rational functions and simple polynomial ratios. We must avoid SR-similar expressions and maintain variety.\n\n- From the dataset, as x1 increases, y tends to flatten. This could be well captured by functions that asymptotically approach a certain value.\n\n- The first equation c[0]*x1+c[1] is a simple linear function. To improve complexity while maintaining simplicity, we can consider variations of linear expressions with a divisor or a constant denominator.\n\n- The second equation c[0]/(x1+c[1])+c[1] uses a rational expression. We can consider other combinations of rational expressions that might offer a trade-off between complexity and fitting accuracy.\n\n- The third equation c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1])+c[2] is a complex rational function.

Previous expressions like '(c[0]*x1+c[1])/(x1+c[2])+c[3]' and 'c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1])+c[2]' show a common pattern of using rational forms, which help in reducing complexity while maintaining low error.\n\n5. The expression 'c[0]/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]' is the simplest rational function with a complexity of 7 and an MSE of 0.00117965, showing that simpler rational functions are effective.\n\n6. The best MSE so far is from '(c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2])/(x1+c[3])' with a complexity of 15 and MSE of 0.00108275, indicating a good balance.\n\nTo generate new expressions, we should aim for combinations that are diverse and are not SR-similar to the existing ones:\n\n- Exploring combinations that use different orders of x1 or mix different arithmetic operations can yield diverse expressions.\n\n- Consider using structures like (ax1 + b) / (cx1 + d) as they provide a rational function base similar to previous low MSE examples.\n\n- Avoid any form that has already been explored or is SR-similar to existing forms.\n\nGiven the complexity and MSE trade-off, here are three new diverse expressions:\n\n1. \"(c[0] + c[1]*x1)/(c[2] + x1)\"\n   - A rational form that is different from existing expressions by having x1 in both numerator and denominator, providing a potentially good fit without being too complex or SR-similar.\n\n2. \"c[0]*x1/(c[1] + c[2]*x1) + c[3]\"\n   - This expression uses a rational term with x1 in both the numerator and denominator, offering a different type of non-linearity capture.\n\n3. \"(c[0]*x1 + c[1])/(c[2]*x1 + c[3]) + c[4]\"\n   - A more balanced rational expression with an additional constant, allowing for flexible fitting with a different form than already suggested.",

  (low mean squared error) and simple (low complexity). \n2. 
  We must ensure that the suggested equations are not SR-similar to the given ones. 
  \n3. Possible strategies:\n   - Use a combination of linear and inverse terms.\n   
  - Consider using combinations like (a/x1 + b) or (a*x1 + b/x1).\n   
  - Use different arrangements or combinations of operations to ensure diversity.
  \n\nAnalyzing the provided equations and their complexities:
  \n- The simplest one (complexity 5) is linear: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]`.
  \n- Inverse linear: `c[0]/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]` (complexity 7).
  \n- Rational expressions with polynomials in the denominator: complexity ranges from 9 to 17.
  \n\nPotential new suggestions:\n- Consider using expressions with both multiplication and division, 
  but in different configurations than provided.
  \n- Avoid using two terms in the numerator or denominator if it's already present in the given ones.
  \n- Try to create combinations that are not apparent in the provided list, like combining addition 
  and division differently.
  \n\nProposed Expressions:\n1. Use a combination of linear and inverse components to achieve balance: 
  `c[0] * x1 / (c[1] + c[2] * x1) + c[3] / x1` - ensures a blend of high and low values potentially.
  \n2. Use a nested division to potentially capture more complex relationships: 
  `c[0] / (x1 + c[1] / (c[2] + x1))` - adds a layer of complexity not directly suggested.
  \n3. Explore a new rational form not explicitly covered: `(c[0] + c[1] * x1) / (c[2] + x1 + c[3] / x1)` - combines elements of

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n1. From the given dataset, we observe that y increases with x1, but the rate of increase changes, suggesting a non-linear relationship. \n2. The existing equations have a range of complexities and mean square errors (MSE). We need to balance complexity and MSE for the new equations.\n3. The simplest (linear) equation has a high MSE, indicating non-linearity is necessary.\n4. The more complex equations have similar MSEs, suggesting diminishing returns on complexity.\n5. The equations involve rational expressions of x1, suggesting division is essential to model the data properly.\n6. Observing the current Pareto front, equations like 'c[0]/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]' feature inverses of x1, which effectively capture non-linear trends with relatively low complexity.\n7. The complexity range for the current set is from 5 to 17; aim for new expressions to be within this range or slightly exceed if justified.\n8. Focus on creating diverse structures that are not SR-similar to existing ones. For instance, using different polynomial degrees or structures in the numerator or denominator.\n9. Possible new structures:\n   - A combination of linear and inverse terms to capture initial rapid increase and subsequent leveling.\n   - Variation in the denominator structure to allow for different asymptotic behaviors.\n   - Use of simple polynomial structures in both numerator and denominator.\n\nPossible new equations:\n1. \"(c[0]*x1 + c[1]) / (c[2]*x1 + x1**2 + c[3])\" - introduces a quadratic term in the denominator for asymptotic control.\n2. \"c[0] + c[1]/(x1 + c[2]*x1**2)\" - uses a simple rational function with polynomial terms to capture non-linear increase.\n3. \"(c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1**2) / (c[3] + x1)\" - polynomial terms in numerator allow capturing both initial rise and later plateau.",
