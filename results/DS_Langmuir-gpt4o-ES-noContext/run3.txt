It appears to have a non-linear growth pattern. \n\n2. Visual inspection or a quick plot would suggest a possible logarithmic or power relationship, but let's explore using the acceptable operators.\n\n3. One simple way to start is to try linear and quadratic terms, as they often capture basic non-linear trends:\n   - y could be c0 + c1 * x1\n   - y could be c0 + c1 * x1 + c2 * x1^2\n\n4. Try scaling or inverse relationships:\n   - The rise could be modeled using a reciprocal relationship like y = c0 + c1 / x1\n   - Or using a direct inverse like y = c0 - c1 / x1\n\n5. Consider a transformation: Given the steep rise, a transformation involving division might stabilize the growth:\n   - y could potentially be modeled as y = c0 + c1 * x1 / (c2 + x1)\n\n6. Considering the exponential rise and saturation at higher values of x1, a saturated growth model could be useful:\n   - y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)",

The simplest equation `c[0]+c[1]*x1` has a complexity of 5 and an MSE of 0.03418604. However, more complex ones like `c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1*x1+c[3]*x1*x1*x1` have lower MSE (0.00289322) but significantly higher complexity (19).\n   \n   - Equations with complexity 9 to 13 have much lower MSE values (~0.0011), suggesting that expressions including divisions are beneficial.\n\n2. **Developing New Suggestions:**\n\n   - We need to consider expressions not SR-similar to existing ones. Avoid forms already presented: `c[0]+c[1]*x1`, `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)`, and variations of these forms.\n\n3. **Formulating New Equations:**\n\n   - Attempt combinations of linear and rational functions, possibly including additional multiplicative terms or nested divisions.\n   \n   - Consider terms like `(x1^2)` or `(x1^3)` to capture non-linear behavior without repeating terms already present in existing equations.\n\n4. **Proposed New Equations:**\n\n   - **Equation 1:** `c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1*x1/(c[3] + x1)`\n     - This combines a linear term, a non-linear quadratic term, and rational function behavior, likely capturing data trends better.\n   \n   - **Equation 2:** `c[0] + c[1]*x1 + x1/(c[2] + x1*c[3])`\n     - A combination of linear and rational terms with a slightly different structure to avoid SR-similarity.\n   \n   - **Equation 3:** `c[0] + c[1]/(x1 + c[2]*x1)`\n     - Simple form, focusing on a rational expression with division by a linear combination of `x1`.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Analyzing the dataset, it seems like a non-linear relationship between y and x1. As x1 increases, y seems to increase, but not at a constant rate. This suggests a non-linear model might be more appropriate than a simple linear one.\n\n2. The provided equations show a progression in complexity and a decrease in mean squared error (mse). Lower complexity models have higher mse, while more complex models fit the data better.\n\n3. The task is to propose new expressions that balance complexity and loss (mse) and are diverse from previous suggestions. They should avoid SR-similar expressions to what has already been suggested.\n\n4. Observing previous equations, they primarily utilize rational functions and combinations of linear terms with fractions. To ensure diversity, consider using different formulations or combinations that adhere to these guidelines.\n\n5. Some potential new forms might include:\n   - Trying different combinations of x1 in the numerator and denominator.\n   - Including a subtraction or addition of a constant term to introduce asymmetry and non-linearity.\n   - Exploring the use of multiple terms with varying dependencies on x1.\n\n6. For diversity, consider:\n   - Different arrangements of linear and inverse relationships.\n   - Alternative uses of x1 in denominators to change how x1 influences the outcome.\n\n7. Aim to keep complexity low (between 5 to 15) to maintain interpretability and simplicity.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe dataset provided shows that the dependent variable y has a non-linear relationship with the independent variable x1. The existing equations from the Pareto front show a variety of expressions with varying complexity and mean square error (mse). We need to suggest three new equations that minimize both complexity and mse, while being diverse from the existing ones.\n\n1. Starting with simpler expressions, we note that existing expressions already include forms with x1 in the denominator and x1 in the numerator. We can consider combinations of these forms without repeating existing patterns.\n   \n2. A possible new simple form is \"c0 + c1 * x1 / (c2 + x1**2)\", which introduces a square term in the denominator, not seen in the existing Pareto front.\n   \n3. Another approach is to introduce a subtraction term such as \"c0 + c1 * x1 - c2 / (c3 + x1**2)\", which slightly increases complexity but could capture more nuances in the data.\n   \n4. We can also consider an expression like \"c0 + c1 / (x1**2 + c2) + c3 * x1\", which combines both an inverse square term and a linear term.\n\nThese suggestions are distinct from existing expressions in the dataset and aim to introduce new functional forms that could potentially fit the data better with acceptable complexity.",
