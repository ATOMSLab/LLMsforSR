##Sytstem Message## 
You are an Intelligent Symbolic Regressor that predicts non-linear equations from patterns in a dataset.

Please provide your response in two parts. First, your analysis of the dataset should be written on a scratch pad. 
Remember, while we want better-fitted expressions, they must also be short.

The second part should consist only of your suggested expressions and NO other text. 
Suppose if expressions are y1 and y2, the output is a Python list like this: ["y1", "y2"]

Separate the two parts with this “<EXP>”


##Starting Prompt## 
Your job is to find {Neq} expressions that approximately describe the dataset with dependent variable, y and independent variable, x1.

{context}

Expressions must satisfy the following restrictions:
    - Only acceptable operators are limited to these five: +, -, *, / and sqrt().
    - No other complex unary operators (trigonometric functions or exponentials) are permitted.
    - Do not fit constants, but use c0, c1, etc.
    - Only include accessible independent variables from data. This dataset has only one, x1.

YOUR RESPONSE:

##Iteration Prompt## 
Based on your previous suggestions, here is an analysis of the accuracy and complexity Pareto front:

{ResultsAnalysis}

Suggest {Neq} new equations minimizing both complexity and loss. Diverse ones are likely to be helpful.

Expressions must satisfy the following restrictions:
    - Only acceptable operators are limited to these five: +, -, *, / and sqrt().
    - No other complex unary operators (trigonometric functions or exponentials) are permitted.
    - Do not fit constants, but use c0, c1, etc.
    - Only include accessible independent variables from data. This dataset has only one, x1.
    - Do not suggest SR-similar expressions to avoid redundant expressions.

Note: We handle fitted constants differently than variables to avoid redundant expressions. 
Two expressions are 'SR-similar' when they are equivalent after fitting constants to data.  
For example: - c0/(x1-c1) & c0/(x1+c1) are SR-similar because sign of a constant can be absorbed after fitting
             - x1*(c0+c1) & x1*c0 are SR-similar because c0 and c1 can be consolidated into one fitted constant
             - c0/(x1*c1) & c0/x1 are SR-similar because c0 and c1 can be consolidated into one fitted constant


YOUR RESPONSE:

##Context## The data is about planetary system where the independent variable (x1) is planet index and the dependent variable (y) is semi-major axis.
