We could consider increasing the degree or adding a non-linear transformation.\n\n2. The second equation is 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**2+c[3]*x1**3' with a complexity of 17 and an mse of 3.7026888. This is a polynomial of degree 3, which has significantly lower mse but higher complexity. We could consider other forms or simplifications to reduce mse while keeping complexity low.\n\n3. The third equation is 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' with a complexity of 6 and an mse of 0.06324868. This indicates an exponential growth pattern that fits the data quite well. It's a good candidate to explore other exponential forms or rational forms.\n\n4. To introduce diversity, we could consider rational functions or other forms of exponential functions. These can sometimes capture the growth patterns seen in planetary systems and semi-major axes.\n\n5. Avoiding SR-similar expressions, we should look for expressions that involve different operations or structures than those already considered.\n\nPotential new expressions:\n\n- Rational function: Use division to capture potential asymptotic behavior.\n- Exponential with a shift or offset: Introduce a shift in the exponent to capture different growth dynamics.\n- Polynomial with different structures: Perhaps a combination of exponential and polynomial terms.\n\nConsidering these ideas, here are three diverse forms:\n\n1. Rational Function: c0 / (x1 + c1)\n2. Exponential with offset: c0 * exp(c1 * (x1 + c2))\n3. Combination of exponential and polynomial: c0 * exp(c1 * x1) + c2 * x1",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The dataset indicates an exponential growth trend in the semi-major axis as the planet index increases. This suggests the utility of exponential expressions in capturing the pattern.\n\n2. The Pareto front analysis previously considered expressions like:\n   - `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)` with low complexity (6) and low MSE (0.06324868).\n   - Polynomial expressions up to cubic terms were used, but with higher complexities and MSE values.\n\n3. The exponential form seems to capture the pattern well, so we should explore variations of exponential expressions while maintaining low complexity.\n\n4. To generate diverse expressions, consider:\n   - Adding linear terms to the exponential form.\n   - Using different combinations of multiplication and division with exponential functions.\n   - Introducing another simple term like `c[2]*(x1^2)` to see if it adds significant value without increasing complexity much.\n\n5. The new expressions must avoid being SR-similar to those already provided.

This is consistent with the low MSE of the exponential equations in the provided list.\n2.

The equation `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]` has a slightly higher complexity (8) but a much better MSE (0.0068813), suggesting that the addition of a constant term further improves the fit.\n4. The dataset shows rapid growth, suggesting that polynomial terms alone might not be sufficient. However, combinations with exponential terms may yield new insights without redundancy.\n5. Considering the restriction on SR-similar expressions, we need to ensure diversity. The existing exponential terms are well-represented, so incorporating new polynomial or rational terms may provide novel insights.\n6. A rational expression like `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+exp(c[2]*x1))` might offer a balance in complexity and accuracy, incorporating both growth and decay components.\n7. The dataset's growth pattern suggests trying combinations of exponential and rational terms, avoiding SR-similarity to the given expressions.",
