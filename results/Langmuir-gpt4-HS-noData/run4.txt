The equation with the third least MSE, 'c[0]*x1**c[1]+c[2]*log(x1)', has a complexity of 10. This complexity can be reduced by removing the logarithmic term, which will likely increase the MSE.\n\nThe three suggested equations will be diverse and simpler while possibly having slightly higher MSE values.",
