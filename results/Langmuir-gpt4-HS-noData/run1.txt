The constraints on the formulation of new equations necessitate the consideration of a balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy. Thus, the challenge is to suggest expressions that are not SR-similar to those already provided, while adhering to the constraints on the use of operators and variables.\n\nGiven that the independent variable is pressure (x1) and the dependent variable is loading (y), physical considerations of the adsorption process can also be taken into account. The unary operations (square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp) and binary operations (+, -, *, and /) offer a range of possibilities for the construction of meaningful expressions.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, three new equations can be proposed.",

A more complex model, using the exponential operator: 'c[0]*exp(x1/c[1])'\n\nThe first model is a simple one, making use of the unary operator sqrt.

Use 'sqrt' operator with 'log' operator and addition binary operator. This should generate an expression that is different from the existing ones and potentially reduce the MSE. \n\n2. Combine 'sqrt' operator with multiplication binary operator. This should result in a new expression with lower complexity. \n\n3. Use 'exp' operator with subtraction binary operator.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the data and the restrictions given, the most apparent pattern that stands out is the logarithmic and square root relationship that the variables share. We can see that with the provided equations, the mean squared error decreases as we increase the complexity of the function.\n\nHowever, it is also noted that increasing the complexity of the function does not always lead to a decrease in the mean squared error as evident from 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*log(x1)' and 'c[0]*log(x1)**c[1]'. This suggests that there might be a sweet spot in the complexity of the function that gives us the minimum mean squared error, and we do not necessarily have to make our function extremely complex.\n\nTo minimize both complexity and loss, the proposed expressions should aim to incorporate the effective features of the existing equations, such as the use of logarithms and square roots, while maintaining a reasonable level of simplicity. Recognizing that the data is about nitrogen adsorbing onto mica, it's also sensible to consider physical and chemical properties of the process which may influence the mathematical relationship between pressure (x1) and loading (y).\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, a few potential expressions could be:\n\n1. \"c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*x1\" - This equation is a combination of already effective features (sqrt, linear x1) and is relatively simple.\n2. \"c[0]*log(x1)*x1\" - This equation introduces the concept of a logarithmic-linear relationship, which has not been explored yet.\n3. \"c[0]*exp(-x1)\" - This equation introduces the concept of a exponential decay, which is a common relationship in adsorption processes.\n\nWhile these equations are relatively simple, they incorporate different mathematical concepts which have the potential to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
