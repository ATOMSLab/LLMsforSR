As pressure increases, loading also increases, but not in a linear fashion.\n\nLet's start with some simple expressions that might fit this data. Given the nature of the problem \u2013 nitrogen adsorbing onto mica \u2013 we could expect the loading to increase logarithmically with pressure, or to follow a power-law relationship. We could also consider a combination of these two.\n\n1) The first expression could be a logarithmic function of the pressure. The logarithm may be a natural log (ln), which is the logarithm to the base 'e'. The general form of this equation would be y = c0*log(x1).\n\n2) The second expression could be a power-law relationship. This is a relationship between two quantities where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other. The general form of this relationship is y = c0*x1^c1. \n\n3) The third expression could be a combination of the two above. We could combine the logarithmic and power-law relationships into a single expression. The general form of this equation would be y = c0*log(x1) + c1*x1^c2.",
