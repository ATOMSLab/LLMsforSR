  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the dataset insights, we aim to generate new, diverse expressions that balance simplicity and accuracy. We need to ensure the expressions aren't SR-similar to those already given, so we must avoid patterns that can easily be reduced to existing ones.\n\n1. **Current Pareto Front Analysis**:\n   - The simplest existing expression is `c[0]*x1`, which is linear.\n   - The most complex one is `(c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2])/(c[3]*x1**2+c[4]*x1+c[5])`, which is quite complex with many parameters.\n   - We should explore different structures, like using subtraction or different polynomial combinations, that aren't present yet.\n\n2. **Potential New Structures**:\n   - A subtraction-based structure: `c[0]*x1 - c[1]/(c[2] + x1)`\n   - A new polynomial structure: `(c[0] + c[1]*x1**2)/(c[2] + x1)`\n   - A mixture of multiplicative and additive terms: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1/(c[2] + x1**2)`\n\n3. **Avoiding SR-similar expressions**:\n   - Ensure any new expression can't be reduced to or is currently on the Pareto front.\n   - Utilize subtraction or alternative polynomial terms to create distinct forms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following new expressions are proposed:",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. From the given expressions, we see patterns involving linear, quadratic, and cubic terms in both the numerator and denominator. The challenge is to suggest diverse forms while minimizing complexity and loss.\n\n2. The simplest expressions such as 'c[0]/(x1+c[1])' and 'c[0]*x1' have high MSE, indicating that they don't capture the complexity of the data well.\n\n3. Mid-range complexity expressions like 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' and '(c[0]+c[1]*x1**2)/(c[2]+x1)' have better MSE, suggesting quadratic terms are helpful.\n\n4. The highest complexity expressions involve cubic terms in the numerator, but we should aim for simpler expressions to maintain a good balance.\n\n5. Potential new forms:\n   - Introduce mixed terms such as x1 multiplied by a constant plus a quadratic or cubic term in the denominator.\n   - Consider cross-terms like (x1+c0)*(x1+c1) in either the numerator or denominator for diversity.\n   - Since SR-similar expressions should be avoided, we need to ensure that the structural form is varied.\n\n6. Potential candidates:\n   - c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1**2 + c[3])\n   - (c[0]*x1 + c[1])/(c[2] + c[3]*x1**3)\n   - c[0]*x1**2/(c[1] + c[2]*x1**2)\n\n7.
