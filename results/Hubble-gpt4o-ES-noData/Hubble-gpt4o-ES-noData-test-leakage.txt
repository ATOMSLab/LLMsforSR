      ...Sure, let's analyze the dataset.

Scratch Pad:

1. Given the context of physical cosmology, 
  the dataset might relate to Hubble's Law, which describes the expansion of the universe. Hubble's Law is generally represented as v = H0 * d, 
  where v is the speed of separation, H0 is the Hubble constant, and d is the proper distance to a galaxy. This implies a linear 
  relationship, which would translate to y = c0 * x1 in our context.

2. Since we are restricted to using basic arithmetic operations, 
  we can only construct simple expressions. Considering non-linear relationships, we might explore quadratic forms or rational expressions 
  involving x1.

3. A quadratic expression could be of the form y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2. This includes both a linear and a non-linear 
  component.

4. Rational expressions could involve divisions like y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1), which would produce a curve that levels 
  off as x1 increases, potentially modeling asymptotic behavior.

5. Another simple model could be y = c0 / (c1 + x1), representing an 
  inverse relationship that might capture decreasing separation speed with increa...

      ...Scratch Pad:
1. Understand the context: The data represents a relationship between the proper distance to a galaxy (x1) 
  and the speed of separation (y). This is reminiscent of Hubble's Law in cosmology, where velocity (y) is proportional to distance (x1).

2. Basic form: Given the restriction of operators and constants, we must find expressions involving x1 and constants like c0, c1, etc.
   - A simple linear model could be: y = c0 * x1

3. Alternative forms:
   - Polynomial: Adding a quadratic or cubic term can capture more complexity: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2
   - Rational: Using division might capture non-linear relationships: y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)

4. Constraints: We cannot use non-polynomial functions, so must rely on combinations of x1 and constants using the four basic operations.

5. Shorter expressions preferred, but complexity needed to capture non-linear relations....

      ...Scratch Pad:

The dataset appears to relate the speed of separation to the proper distance to a galaxy. 
  This is reminiscent of Hubble's Law, which states that the recessional velocity of a galaxy is proportional to its distance from us. 
  In simple terms, it suggests a linear relationship: v = H0 * d, where v is the velocity, d is the distance, and H0 is the Hubble constant.
  

Given the constraints, we should start with a linear expression and then explore other simple polynomial or rational expressions. 
  

1. Linear Model: The simplest form is a linear relationship. This would be y = c0 * x1. This captures the essence of Hubble's Law.

2. Quadratic Model: A quadratic term might capture any potential non-linearity at larger distances. This would be y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2. 

3. Rational Model: A rational expression such as y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1) might model a scenario where velocity increases with distance but saturates at a certain speed....

      ...Scratch Pad:
- The dataset is likely related to Hubble's Law in cosmology, where the speed of separation of a galaxy (y) is proportional to its distance (x1).
- A simple linear relationship might be a good starting point: y = c0 * x1.
- We could also consider potential quadratic or inverse relationships. However, since we are restricted to basic arithmetic operations, any non-linear pattern would have to be expressed as a polynomial or rational expression.
- Another expression could involve a combination of linear and inverse terms like (c0 * x1 + c1/x1).
- The dataset might also exhibit a more complex relationship, possibly requiring a rational polynomial form like (c0 * x1 + c1) / (c2 + x1).

Based on these considerations, the expressions could be:
1. Linear: y = c0 * x1
2. Simple rational: y = (c0 * x1 + c1) / (c2 + x1)
3. Combination of linear and inverse: y = c0 * x1 + c1 / x1...

      ...Scratch Pad:

1. Understand the Problem:
   - We have a dataset with x1 as the independent variable (proper distance to a galaxy) and y as the dependent variable (speed of separation).
   - The task is to find 3 mathematical expressions using only basic arithmetic operators and constants (c0, c1, etc.).

2. Consider Physics Context:
   - The dataset is related to physical cosmology. The speed of separation can relate to the Hubble's law which states that the recession velocity is proportional to the distance.

3. Potential Simple Models:
   - Linear Model: This can represent a straightforward direct proportionality.
     Example: y = c0 * x1
   - Polynomial Model: A second-order polynomial can capture more complexity.
     Example: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1 * x1
   - Rational Model: A rational function could capture asymptotic behavior or saturation effects.
     Example: y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)

4. Generate Possible Expressions:
   - Linear: y = c0 * x1
   - Quadratic: y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1 * x1
   - Rational: y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)

5. Check Simplicity:
   - Ensure expressions are not overly complex while still providing a good fit....
