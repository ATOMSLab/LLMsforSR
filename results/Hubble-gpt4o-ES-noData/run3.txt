  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe dataset appears to relate the speed of separation to the proper distance to a galaxy. 
  This is reminiscent of Hubble's Law, which states that the recessional velocity of a galaxy is proportional to its distance from us. 
  In simple terms, it suggests a linear relationship: v = H0 * d, where v is the velocity, d is the distance, and H0 is the Hubble constant.
  \n\nGiven the constraints, we should start with a linear expression and then explore other simple polynomial or rational expressions. 
  \n\n1. Linear Model: The simplest form is a linear relationship. This would be y = c0 * x1. This captures the essence of Hubble's Law.\n\n2. Quadratic Model: A quadratic term might capture any potential non-linearity at larger distances. This would be y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2. \n\n3. Rational Model: A rational expression such as y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1) might model a scenario where velocity increases with distance but saturates at a certain speed.",

Analyzing the current equations:\n   - The simplest equation is a linear one: 'c[0]*x1', with a complexity of 3 and a high mse of 31135.22243454.\n   - The second equation introduces a non-linear term using division: 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)', with complexity 7 and a lower mse of 29704.12882079.
