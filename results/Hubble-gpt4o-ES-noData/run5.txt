It suggests a form of exponential decay behavior.\n   - The third equation introduces a quadratic term: `c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*x1`, which represents a parabolic curve.\n\n2. Consider potential new forms:\n   - A rational function could be considered, with numerator or denominator being linear or quadratic.\n   - Test expressions that blend linear and nonlinear terms in new ways.\n   - Use division to explore inverse relations or decay-like behavior.\n\n3. Generate potential equations:\n   - Consider a quadratic form in the denominator: `c[0]*x1/(c[1] + c[2]*x1*x1)`. This creates a rational function with a quadratic denominator.\n   - Try a mixed linear and cubic relation: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1*x1 + c[2]*x1*x1*x1`. This adds a cubic term to capture more complex variations.\n   - Use a nested division structure: `c[0]/(c[1] + x1/(c[2] + x1))`.

The simplest form is linear, but the given linear equation has a high mse. We need to introduce some non-linear components to reduce mse while keeping the complexity low.\n2. The existing non-linear equations seem to explore different structures like rational functions and polynomial expressions.\n\nConsidering the restrictions, we can look for diverse structures:\n- Non-linear rational expressions with simple polynomial forms in the numerator or denominator.\n- Balanced use of multiplication and division to create non-linear interactions without increasing complexity too much.\n\nPossible new expressions:\n1. An expression with a simple non-linear term, such as a quadratic term in the denominator to provide a non-linear scaling effect.\n2. A combination of linear and quadratic terms in the numerator divided by a linear term.\n3. A polynomial expression with a focus on a cubic term, but balanced in terms of other components to ensure it's different from the existing suggestions.\n\nPotential candidates:\n1. c0*x1/(c1 + x1 + c2*x1*x1)\n2. c0*x1/(c1 + c2*x1 + c3*x1*x1)\n3. c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1*x1/(c3 + x1)\n\nThese candidates aim to explore different interactions between x1 and coefficients, providing diverse options for fitting the data.",
