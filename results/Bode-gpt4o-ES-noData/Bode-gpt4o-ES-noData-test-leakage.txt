      ...Sure, let's analyze the dataset on the scratch pad first.


  Scratch Pad:

1. First, let's understand the context. The independent variable x1 represents the planet index, and the dependent variable 
  y represents the semi-major axis. In planetary systems, the semi-major axis often follows a pattern or sequence based on planetary index 
  due to gravitational interactions and orbital dynamics.

2. In a simplified model, the semi-major axis might be proportional to some power 
  of the planet index. This is because the distances can increase in a geometric sequence, similar to Bode's law.

3. 
  A common approach is to test power laws, for instance, y = c0 * x1^c1, where the semi-major axis could fit into a power sequence based 
  on the index.

4. Another possibility is an exponential relationship, where y might increase exponentially with the planet index. 
  This would be expressed as y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1).

5. A linear or affine transformation could be considered if the planetary index reflects a linear increase or if the semi-major axis follows a simple arithmetic sequence, expressed as y = c0 * x1 + c1.

6. We should also consider combining basic operations to explore polynomial relationships, such as y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2, which could capture quadratic growth patterns.

Given these considerations, let's suggest a few candidate expressions....

      ...Scratch Pad:
- The dataset involves planetary systems, where we predict the semi-major axis (y) based on the 
  planet index (x1).
- The semi-major axis is often described by Titius-Bode law and other patterns that suggest geometric or exponential growth.
  
- We can start with simple polynomial or exponential expressions since they often describe planetary orbits well.

Possible simple 
  expressions:
1. Linear: y = c0 + c1 * x1
   - Simplest form, unlikely but a good baseline to start.
2. 
  Exponential: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)
   - Captures exponential growth, common in natural phenomena.
3. 
  Power law: y = c0 * x1^c1
   - Captures polynomial growth, which is another possibility for planetary systems.
  

Considerations:
- We avoid fitting constants directly, using placeholders (c0, c1) instead.
  
- Aim for short, interpretable expressions that capture potential growth patterns seen in planetary systems....
