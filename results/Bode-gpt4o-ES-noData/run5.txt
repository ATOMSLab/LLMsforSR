  Exponential: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)\n   - Captures exponential growth, common in natural phenomena.\n3. 
  Power law: y = c0 * x1^c1\n   - Captures polynomial growth, which is another possibility for planetary systems.

Exponential growth models like `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)` are highly accurate, but we need to consider alternatives that could also capture non-linear patterns.\n3. Power-law models are covered by `c[0]*x1**c[1]`, so we should think of different structures.\n\nConsidering these, possible candidates could be:\n\n- A rational function: `c[0]/(x1 + c[1])` which is neither a pure polynomial nor an exponential form, offering a different behavior.\n- A composite function structure like `c[0] * (1 + c[1]*x1)^c[2]`, which adds complexity but could fit patterns not captured by simpler models.\n- A form that combines linear and exponential terms: `c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*exp(c[3]*x1)` which could capture both linear trends and exponential growth.\n\nThese suggestions aim to provide a balance between complexity and the ability to accurately capture data patterns without being redundant to the existing Pareto front.",

Current best solutions have complexity ranging from 5 to 18 and mse values from 0.00656492 to 33.77803354.\n3. The simplest equation with a relatively low mse is 'c[0]+c[1]*x1', which has complexity 5 and mse 33.77803354.\n4. The most complex equation with the lowest mse is 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*exp(c[3]*x1)', which has complexity 12 and mse 0.00656492.\n5. We should search for equations that are not SR-similar to the ones already provided, while also being diverse in terms of form and operators used.\n\nCandidate Equations:\n- Consider using different combinations of exponential functions and polynomials, as these have shown promising results in the previous list.\n- Avoid redundancy by ensuring that the expression cannot be reduced to a form similar to existing ones.\n\nPotential Candidates:\n1. 'c[0] + c[1] / (1 + c[2] * x1^2)'\n   - Diversity: Uses division and a quadratic term in the denominator.\n   - Complexity: Moderate.\n   - Expected mse: Should be relatively low as it introduces non-linear behavior.\n\n2. 'c[0] * x1 + c[1] * exp(-c[2] * x1^2)'\n   - Diversity: Combines linear and exponential decay with a quadratic exponent.\n   - Complexity: Moderate to high.\n   - Expected mse: Could be very low if the system exhibits exponential decay features.\n\n3. 'c[0] - c[1] * x1^2 / (1 + c[2] * exp(c[3] * x1))'\n   - Diversity: Combines polynomial and exponential terms in a new way.\n   - Complexity: Higher, but offers a distinct form.\n   - Expected mse: Should capture complex dependencies effectively, potentially low.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nFrom the given dataset and expressions, we want to minimize both complexity and loss while ensuring diversity among the expressions to avoid SR-similarity.\n\n1. We observe that simpler expressions with lower complexity like 'c[0]+c[1]*x1' (complexity: 5) have higher MSE. This implies they are too simple to capture the data accurately. \n\n2. At the other end, a more complex expression 'c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**2*exp(c[3]*x1)' (complexity: 16) has a very low MSE of 0.03046469. However, it is too complex given the constraint to minimize complexity.\n\n3. The expression 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' (complexity: 6) offers low MSE at 0.06324868. This seems promising as it balances complexity and accuracy.\n\n4. The expression 'c[0]/(1+c[1]*x1)' (complexity: 7) also provides a low MSE of 1.10985113, but there might be room for improvement in accuracy without significantly increasing complexity.\n\n5. To achieve diverse expressions, we need to explore different mathematical forms. For instance, including powers of x1, or adding/subtracting an exponential term.\n\n6. A combination of polynomial and exponential terms might capture the pattern well while maintaining diversity.\n\nPossible new expressions to explore:\n- A polynomial with an exponential factor: c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1^2*exp(-c[3]*x1)\n- A rational expression with an additional power: c[0]/(1+c[1]*x1^2)\n- A ratio of exponential terms: c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)/(1+c[2]*x1)",
