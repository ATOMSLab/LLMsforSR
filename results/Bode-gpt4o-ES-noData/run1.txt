  **Consider Linear and Polynomial Relationships:**\n   - A simple linear equation could be y = c0 * x1. 
  However, planetary orbits typically follow more complex laws.\n   - A quadratic or polynomial relation like y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 might be 
  considered, but it could be too simple for planetary systems.\n\n2. 
  **Consider Exponential Relationships:**\n   - Planetary systems often follow exponential or power laws, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
  \n   - An expression like y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1) could be plausible, as it captures exponential growth.\n\n3. 
  **Consider Inverse and Reciprocal Relationships:**\n   - Inverse relationships such as y = c0 / x1 or y = c0 / (c1 + x1) might capture 
  relationships where growth slows down for larger x1.\n\n4. **Consider Power Laws:**\n   - Power laws are also common in physics, 
  such as y = c0 * x1^c1, which can be used to capture polynomial growth.\n\n5. **Combination of Expressions:**\n
