  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Sure, let's analyze the dataset on the scratch pad first.\n\n
  Scratch Pad:\n\n1. First, let's understand the context. The independent variable x1 represents the planet index, and the dependent variable 
  y represents the semi-major axis. In planetary systems, the semi-major axis often follows a pattern or sequence based on planetary index 
  due to gravitational interactions and orbital dynamics.\n\n2. In a simplified model, the semi-major axis might be proportional to some power 
  of the planet index. This is because the distances can increase in a geometric sequence, similar to Bode's law.\n\n3. 
  A common approach is to test power laws, for instance, y = c0 * x1^c1, where the semi-major axis could fit into a power sequence based 
  on the index.\n\n4. Another possibility is an exponential relationship, where y might increase exponentially with the planet index. 
  This would be expressed as y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1).\n\n5. A linear or affine transformation could be considered if the planetary index reflects a linear increase or if the semi-major axis follows a simple arithmetic sequence, expressed as y = c0 * x1 + c1.\n\n6. We should also consider combining basic operations to explore polynomial relationships, such as y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2, which could capture quadratic growth patterns.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's suggest a few candidate expressions.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe current Pareto front suggests three equations with varying complexities and mean squared errors (MSE). \n\n1.

'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' has a complexity of 6 and an extremely low MSE of 0.06324868, indicating a very good fit to the data and suggesting an exponential relationship. \n\nGiven these observations, we aim to suggest three new equations that balance complexity and MSE while being diverse. We should explore different forms such as ratios, polynomials of higher degree, or combinations of terms. \n\nPotential new equation forms:\n- Polynomial of degree 2: 'c0*x1^2 + c1*x1 + c2' \n- Rational function: 'c0/(x1 + c1)' \n- Exponential with linear term: 'c0*exp(c1*x1) + c2*x1' \n\nThese forms introduce new types of relationships that could potentially offer better fits or insights while maintaining some level of simplicity.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n- The goal is to suggest three new equations that minimize both complexity and loss.\n- We have a few equations with low MSE and varying complexity.\n- The best existing equation by MSE is 'c[0]/(x1**2+c[1])+c[2]*exp(c[3]*x1)' with complexity 14 and a very low MSE.\n- Simpler equations like 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' with complexity 6 also have low MSE.\n  \nTo generate new equations, we'll look for patterns or combinations of existing components that aren't SR-similar to existing ones. Here are some observations:\n\n1. **Exponential Components**: Many equations with low MSE have an exponential term. This suggests that exponential growth or decay is a strong component in the data.\n2. **Rational Components**: Terms of the form c/(x+c) or c/(x^2+c) are common and seem effective.\n3. **Polynomial Components**: Quadratic terms like x^2 also appear in some of the better equations.\n\nConsidering these, we can construct new combinations:\n\n1. An equation with an exponential term and a rational term (not SR-similar to existing ones).\n2. An equation with a product of an exponential and a polynomial term.\n3. An equation that uses both rational and polynomial terms but structured differently than existing ones.\n\nEquations:\n1. \"c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1) + c[2]/(x1^2+c[3])\"\n2. \"c[0]*x1*exp(c[1]*x1) + c[2]/(x1+c[3])\"\n3. \"c[0]*x1^2 + c[1]/(x1^2+c[2])\"",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Current Pareto front analysis shows that equations with exponential terms generally have lower MSEs. Therefore, including exponential terms is beneficial for accuracy.\n\n2. The simplest equation with a low MSE is `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)` with complexity 6 and MSE 0.06324868. This suggests that exponential growth is significant in the dataset.\n\n3. The equation `c[0]*x1+c[1]*exp(c[2]*x1)` with complexity 10 and MSE 0.04423257 shows that adding a linear term to an exponential term further improves the fit, indicating a combined linear-exponential relationship.\n\n4. The equation `c[0]/(x1+c[1])+c[2]*exp(c[3]*x1)` with complexity 12 and MSE 0.00688128 uses a rational function combined with an exponential term, which significantly reduces the MSE. This indicates that combining rational and exponential forms could effectively model the data.\n\n5. Looking for diverse yet lower-complexity expressions, we should consider forms that involve combinations of linear, rational, and exponential functions.\n\n6. A potential new expression could be `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1) + c[2]*x1/(x1+c[3])` which merges exponential and rational forms, similar to successful existing expressions but with a different structure.\n\n7. Another potential structure could be `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+exp(c[2]*x1)) + c[3]`, which introduces a rational function with exponential terms in the denominator, offering a different approach to mixing components.\n\n8. A simpler expression might be `c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1]) + c[2]*x1`, which focuses on combining linear and rational components.",
