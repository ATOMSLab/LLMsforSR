This maintains a low complexity and may provide a good fit if the data follows a logarithmic trend.\n\nThe third equation to suggest is a polynomial one, which includes x1 to the power of 2 and 3, each multiplied by a different constant.

This is a polynomial equation which tends to be quite good at capturing non-linear relationships.

The exponential equation \"c[0]*exp(x1)\" has a complexity of 4 and an MSE of 3032137.37, while the logarithmic equation \"c[0]*log(x1)*x1\" has a complexity of 6 and an MSE of 76323.95.\n\nWe could try to improve upon these by combining these functions in different ways, while ensuring that we don't exceed the complexity of the best performing equation too much. We could also try adding in some additional polynomial terms to capture any non-linearities in the data.\n\nTaking these observations into account, I would suggest the following three equations:\n\n1. \"c[0]*exp(x1)+c[1]*x1\" - This equation combines exponential and linear terms, potentially capturing both fast and slow changing aspects of the data.\n\n2. \"c[0]*log(x1)*x1+c[1]*x1**2\" - This equation combines logarithmic, linear, and polynomial terms, providing a good balance between complexity and potential accuracy.\n\n3. \"c[0]*x1**3+c[1]*x1\" - This is a simpler polynomial equation that may still capture non-linear trends in the data.",
