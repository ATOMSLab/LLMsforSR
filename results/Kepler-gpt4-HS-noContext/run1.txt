  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nThe given dataset suggests a non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable. The dependent variable increases significantly with the increase in the independent variable.\n\nSince the dataset suggests a non-linear relationship, the following operators could be useful:\n- Exponential: to capture rapid growth\n- Logarithmic: to moderate rapid growth\n- Polynomial: to capture non-linear growth\n\nThe Pareto front suggests that both simple (low complexity) and complex expressions (high complexity) have been tried before. The simple expressions tend to have higher error (mse), while the complex expressions tend to have lower error. Notably, the lowest error is achieved with the most complex expression suggested so far, involving up to the fourth power of the independent variable.\n\nTo suggest new expressions, I will:\n- Keep the complexity moderate to balance between fit and simplicity\n- Try different combinations of operators to capture diverse types of non-linear relationships\n- Avoid redundancy with previous suggestions\n\nThe new expressions should involve a combination of polynomial (for non-linear relationship), exponential/logarithmic (for rapid growth), and basic arithmetic operators. Squaring and cubing can be used to increase the complexity of the expressions moderately.",
