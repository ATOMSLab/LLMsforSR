  - The x1 values are representative of planetary distances from a star, resembling Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\n   
  - The y values could potentially represent orbital periods.\n\n2. Possible relationships:\n   
  - Kepler's Third Law suggests that the square of the orbital period (y) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (x1). Therefore, y may be related to x1^1.5 or sqrt(x1^3).\n   - An exponential relationship is possible due to rapid growth, but since x1 values are not extremely large, a power law is more likely than an exponential.\n\n3. Expression considerations:\n   - A power law relationship like y ~ x1^a is a good starting point.\n   - A logarithmic transformation might linearize the data, so y ~ log(x1) could be explored.\n   - For simplicity and based on Kepler's law, y ~ sqrt(x1^3) or y ~ x1^(3/2) are strong candidates.\n\n4. Testing potential expressions:\n   - y ~ x1^1.5\n   - y ~ sqrt(x1^3)\n   - y ~ log(x1) * c0\n   - y ~ exp(x1) * c0\n\nConsider expressions that fit the data pattern well while remaining concise and interpretable.",

There is a significant increase in the dependent variable y as the independent variable x1 increases, indicating a potential polynomial or power relationship.\n3. The existing equations show a trend towards using powers and roots, such as `x1**1.5`, `sqrt(x1)`, and combinations thereof. These seem to fit the dataset well, especially given the low MSE values.\n4. The complexity of the expressions ranges from 3 to 10. The goal is to find new expressions with low complexity and MSE.\n5. Considering the pattern of increasing y with x1, expressions involving powers of x1 (like `x1**1.5`) seem promising.\n6. To ensure diversity and non-redundancy, we should explore expressions not covered by existing ones. For instance, higher powers of x1 (like `x1**2`), combinations of different functions, or different polynomial forms could be considered.\n7. Given the range of x1, logarithmic expressions could be explored, though they often require careful handling due to domain restrictions (x1 must be positive).\n\nNew Expression Suggestions:\n- Consider cubic relationships, e.g., `c0*x1**3 + c1*x1`, which could capture the rapid increase in y.\n- Use combinations of different functions, e.g., `c0*sqrt(x1) + c1*x1**2`, to capture both linear and non-linear trends.\n- Explore logarithmic combinations, e.g., `c0*log(x1) + c1*x1**1.5`, for potential fits with lower complexity.",
