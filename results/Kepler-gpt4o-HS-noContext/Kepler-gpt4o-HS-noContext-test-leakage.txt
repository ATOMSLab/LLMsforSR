      ...Scratch Pad:

1. Analyze the dataset:
   - The dataset shows a significant increase in the y values as x1 increases.
   
  - The x1 values are representative of planetary distances from a star, resembling Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
   
  - The y values could potentially represent orbital periods.

2. Possible relationships:
   
  - Kepler's Third Law suggests that the square of the orbital period (y) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (x1). Therefore, y may be related to x1^1.5 or sqrt(x1^3).
   - An exponential relationship is possible due to rapid growth, but since x1 values are not extremely large, a power law is more likely than an exponential.

3. Expression considerations:
   - A power law relationship like y ~ x1^a is a good starting point.
   - A logarithmic transformation might linearize the data, so y ~ log(x1) could be explored.
   - For simplicity and based on Kepler's law, y ~ sqrt(x1^3) or y ~ x1^(3/2) are strong candidates.

4. Testing potential expressions:
   - y ~ x1^1.5
   - y ~ sqrt(x1^3)
   - y ~ log(x1) * c0
   - y ~ exp(x1) * c0

Consider expressions that fit the data pattern well while remaining concise and interpretable....

      ...Scratch Pad:
- The dataset appears to be related to planetary data where x1 could be the distance from the sun 
  in astronomical units (AUs) and y could represent the orbital period in days.
- By considering Kepler's third law of planetary motion, 
  the orbital period (y) is proportional to the distance from the sun (x1) raised to the power of 1.5.
- 
  This suggests a possible relationship of the form y = c0 * x1^1.5.
- To capture different fits, consider variations using other unary 
  operations like square, cube, and combinations that could potentially improve the fit.
- Explore options such as y = c1 * x1^2, y = c2 * x1^3, 
  y = c3 * x1 + c4, etc., while paying attention to the simplicity requirement.
- We need to avoid fitting constants directly and instead define 
  them as c0, c1, etc.
- Initial exploration shows the formula y = c0 * x1^1.5 aligns well with expected physical laws, specifically for planetary 
  orbits....
