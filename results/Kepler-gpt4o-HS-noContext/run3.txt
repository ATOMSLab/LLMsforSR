Investigating exponential relationships:\n   - An exponential expression (y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)) might fit the data if y grows exponentially with x1.\n   - Logarithmic expressions seem less likely given the rapid growth, but can be considered for transformation.\n\n4.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the dataset and the previous suggestions, let's look for new expressions that could potentially offer a better fit for the data. We need to balance complexity and loss. The list of previous suggestions shows a trend where increasing complexity generally reduces MSE, but with diminishing returns. \n\nThe independent variable `x1` ranges widely from 0.389 to 9.51, suggesting potential non-linear effects. The target `y` also increases non-linearly, which suggests that polynomial or exponential terms may be suitable.\n\nAnalyzing the previous suggestions:\n1. Lower complexity expressions generally had higher MSE, but expressions with complexity between 8 and 11 showed significant improvement.\n2. Expressions with polynomial terms (e.g., x1^2, x1^3) and exponential terms (e.g., exp(x1)) were effective.\n\nTo generate new expressions:\n- Consider combining polynomial terms with exponential or logarithmic transformations, as they seem to capture non-linearities well.\n- Avoid redundancy by ensuring the new expressions are not SR-similar to those already suggested.\n\nPotential new expressions:\n1. Use a combination of polynomial and exponential terms. For example, a combination of x1^2 and exp(x1).\n2. Introduce a logarithmic term, possibly with a polynomial, to capture rapid growth followed by stabilization.\n3. Explore expressions with square roots to capture slower growth at larger x1 values.\n\nCandidate expressions:\n1. c0 * log(x1) + c1 * x1^2\n2. c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1 * exp(x1) + c2\n3. c0 * x1^2 + c1 * log(x1) + c2",
