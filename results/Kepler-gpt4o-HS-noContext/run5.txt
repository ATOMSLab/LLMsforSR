Generate diverse expressions, ensuring they are not SR-similar to the provided:\n   - Expression 1: Perhaps cubic terms or combinations with squares.\n   - Expression 2: Different combination using logs or other roots.\n   - Expression 3: Explore division or subtraction in novel ways.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Let's start by analyzing the data. The y values increase significantly as x1 increases, suggesting a polynomial or exponential relationship. \n\n2. Reviewing the current expressions:\n   - The equation 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1**1.5' has the lowest mse (2.29154239) with a complexity of 11. This suggests something in this family of equations is likely to be effective.\n   - The equation 'c[0]*x1**1.5+c[1]*sqrt(x1)' has a low mse (25.88232122) and complexity (10), indicating that square root terms are relevant.\n   - The equation 'c[0]*x1**1.5' with an mse of 46.68860689 and complexity of 5 is very simple and shows that x1^1.5 is a significant term.\n\n3. Observing the dataset, as x1 increases, y increases rapidly which suggests a polynomial dependency.\n\n4. Taking inspiration from the best equation (in terms of mse), I will:\n   - Include a polynomial term like x1^1.5.\n   - Consider adding a linear or square term to incorporate lower order effects.\n   - Utilize a combination of different powers of x1 to create diverse expressions.\n\n5. New suggestions should be diverse, possibly including combinations of x1^1.5, x1^2, x1^3, and sqrt(x1) while keeping complexity low.",
