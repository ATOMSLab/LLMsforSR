Additionally, we will strive for simplicity by minimizing complexity.\n\n1. Consider an exponential with a linear bias: `c[0] * exp(c[1]*x1) + c[2]`.\n2.

To maintain diversity, consider different algebraic structures like product, sum, and quotient of functions.\n\nProposed New Equations:\n\n1. Use a polynomial added to an exponential function: 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*exp(c[2]*x1)'.\n2. Use a quotient of exponential and polynomial terms: 'c[0]*exp(x1)/(c[1]+c[2]*x1^2)'.\n3. Use a logarithmic transformation with polynomial: 'c[0] + log(c[1]*x1^2 + c[2])'.\n\nThese suggestions aim to balance complexity and accuracy, while maintaining diversity from the existing set of equations.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the dataset and the previously suggested equations, we want to find new expressions that are both diverse and competitive in terms of complexity and mean squared error (MSE).\n\n1. Observing the dataset:\n   - The y values seem to grow rapidly, indicating a potential exponential relationship with x1.\n   - The x1 values include a large negative value (-1000) and smaller values ranging from 0 to 6.\n\n2. Reviewing the existing equations:\n   - The simpler expressions like 'exp(c[0]*x1)' have relatively low complexity but higher MSE.\n   - More complex expressions like 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)/(1+c[2]*x1+c[3]*x1^2)' have lower MSE but higher complexity.\n\n3. Strategy for new equations:\n   - Consider exponential components due to the rapid growth in y values.\n   - Introduce diversity by using different combinations of operators and functions.\n   - Avoid redundancy by ensuring the new expressions are not SR-similar to existing ones.\n\n4. Possible new expressions:\n   a. \"c0 * x1^2 + c1 * exp(x1)\" - Combines polynomial and exponential growth.\n   b. \"c0 / (c1 + exp(c2 * x1))\" - Uses a rational form with an exponential denominator.\n   c. \"c0 * log(1 + c1 * x1) + c2\" - Incorporates a logarithmic component for a different growth pattern.",
