The initial values (when x1 is -1000 and 0) are relatively small, with a significant increase for positive x1 values. This could indicate a polynomial or exponential pattern with a transformation applied.\n3. A simple polynomial (e.g., quadratic or cubic) might fit the data well, given the rapid increase for larger positive x1.\n4. Another possibility is an exponential function since y values grow rapidly.\n5. Considering restrictions, we can use functions like x1^2 (square), exp(x1), and combinations.\n\nPossible expressions:\n1. Given the rapid increase, a simple quadratic form, y = c0 + c1 * x1 + c2 * x1^2, might capture the upward trend for positive x1.\n2. An exponential form like y = exp(c0 * x1) could fit due to the rapid growth.\n3. A cubic model, y = c0 + c1 * x1 + c2 * x1^2 + c3 * x1^3, might also fit well due to the polynomial nature suggested by the data.",

We aim to find new expressions that are not 'SR-similar' to these.\n\nGiven the nature of the dataset (exponential growth with x1), expressions involving exponential terms are likely to fit well. However, we should explore other possibilities too.\n\n1. An expression that involves both exponential and polynomial terms could be promising, provided it is distinct from the previous suggestions.\n2. A combination of logarithmic and polynomial terms might offer a good trade-off between complexity and fit.\n3. A simpler polynomial expression could provide a low-complexity alternative.\n\nLet's consider:\n1. c0 * exp(c1 * x1) + c2 * x1^2\n   - Combines an exponential term with a quadratic polynomial, distinct from previous suggestions.\n\n2. c0 + c1 * log(1 + c2 * x1) + c3 * x1\n   - Uses a logarithmic-transformed x1 with a linear term, ensuring it is distinct from previous expressions.\n\n3. c0 * x1^2 + c1 * sqrt(x1 + c2)\n   - A quadratic polynomial term combined with a square root, adding diversity without relying on exponential terms.",
