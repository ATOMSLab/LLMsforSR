The y values are increasing in a non-linear fashion.\n2. For x1 = 0, y = 0.72, suggesting it might not start at zero (could imply a constant or offset).\n3. From x1 = 1 to x1 = 6, y values increase significantly, indicating a possible exponential or polynomial relationship.\n\nHypotheses:\n- An exponential growth pattern could fit because y increases rapidly.\n- A polynomial relationship, like a quadratic or cubic, could also potentially fit the data.\n\nTesting simple expressions:\n1. Exponential: y = c0 * exp(c1 * x1)\n2. Quadratic: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1\n3. Cubic: y = c0 * x1^3 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1\n\nSimplifying:\n- Exponential form is often used for rapid growth.\n- Quadratic might fit due to the parabolic nature of increase.\n- Cubic could capture more complex curvature if necessary.\n\nLet's construct the equations using these hypotheses.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad: \n1. Analyzing the dataset and the previously suggested equations, we note that expressions involving exponential functions and rational expressions tend to have better fits (lower mse). \n2. The expressions with lowest mse in the existing suggestions are:\n   - 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)/(1+c[2]*x1)' and 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)/(c[2]+x1)', both having mse ~0.02492491 and complexity around 10-12.\n   - 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)' has a very low mse of 0.06324868 with a complexity of 6, indicating that exponential terms are very effective.\n3. The goal is to suggest new equations minimizing both complexity and mse while being diverse.\n4. Consider the patterns: x1 is a small range, but y varies significantly, suggesting a potential exponential growth pattern.\n5. Possible strategies for new expressions: \n   - Incorporate other non-linear transformations or combinations like squares, cubes, or logarithms to capture different nonlinearities.\n   - Use rational expressions to combine both polynomial and exponential components.\n6. Try to suggest shorter and diverse expressions to avoid redundancy with existing ones.",
