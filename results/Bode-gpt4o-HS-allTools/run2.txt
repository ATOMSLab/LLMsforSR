  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Let's analyze the current equations and their performance:\n   - The equation with the lowest MSE (0.0068813) is 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]', with a complexity of 8.\n   - Another low MSE equation is 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]/(c[3]+x1**2)' with an MSE of 0.01089627 and complexity of 14.\n   - The simplest equation with a low MSE is 'exp(c[0]*x1)' with a complexity of 4 and MSE of 1.32407087.\n\n2. We need to suggest three new equations that are diverse and minimize both complexity and MSE. \n   - We should avoid using similar structures to 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]' and 'exp(c[0]*x1)' to ensure diversity.\n   - We should consider using polynomial terms, rational functions, and combinations of exponential and polynomial terms.\n\n3. Identifying potential new structures:\n   - A polynomial with rational terms like 'c0*x1^2 + c1/x1'\n   - A combination of exponential and polynomial terms like 'c0*exp(c1*x1) + c2*x1^3'\n   - A rational function with exponential terms like 'c0/(c1 + exp(c2*x1))'\n\n4. Generating new expressions:\n   - Expression 1: A polynomial with rational terms: 'c0*x1^2 + c1/x1'\n   - Expression 2: A combination of exponential and polynomial terms: 'c0*exp(c1*x1) + c2*x1^3'\n   - Expression 3: A rational function with exponential terms: 'c0/(c1 + exp(c2*x1))'",
