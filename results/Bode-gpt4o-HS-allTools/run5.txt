Analyzing the dataset:\n   - y: [0.39, 0.72, 1.0, 1.52, 2.77, 5.2, 9.58, 19.22]\n   - x1: [-1000, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n   - The data suggests an exponential growth pattern due to the rapid increase in y.\n   - The exponential pattern is consistent with the planetary system where semi-major axis (y) increases rapidly with planet index (x1).\n\n2. Reviewing previous equations:\n   - Equations with exponential terms tend to have low MSE, e.g., 'c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)'.\n   - The simplest exponential form 'c[0]*exp(x1)' also has low complexity and MSE.\n   - Equations like 'c[0]*exp(x1)/(x1+c[1])' manage to balance complexity with accuracy.\n\n3. Deriving new expressions:\n   - Focus on exponential forms due to their performance in capturing the growth pattern.\n   - Incorporate additional transformations to introduce diversity, like using log or square root.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions by ensuring each has unique transformations or combinations of terms.\n\n4. Potential new expressions:\n   - Using exponential and log transformations to model the data effectively.\n   - Include combinations that stand out from previous equations by altering the transformations or operators used.\n\nProposed Expressions:\n1. \"c[0]*exp(x1) + c[1]*log(x1 + c[2])\"\n2. \"c[0]*exp(x1) / (c[1] + sqrt(x1))\"\n3. \"c[0]*x1^2 + c[1]*exp(x1)\"",
