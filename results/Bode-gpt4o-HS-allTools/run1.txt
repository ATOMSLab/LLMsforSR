The existing equations suggest a trend of exponential growth with increasing x1 values. The MSE of the best existing model is 0.06324868, achieved with an exponential term. We should consider leveraging this insight while introducing some diversity in the form of different mathematical operations.\n\nTo avoid SR-similar expressions, we will vary the use of unary operators and the combination of x1 with constants.\n\n1. Attempting a simpler polynomial form might provide a balance between complexity and accuracy. Adding a cubic term could capture non-linearities in the data.\n\n2. Exploring a form that combines both polynomial and exponential terms might capture the rapid growth nature of the dataset.\n\n3. Incorporating logarithmic growth could add diversity and potentially capture underlying trends if the data suggests a change in growth rate over the range.\n\nNow let's construct these expressions:\n\n1.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Understanding the dataset**:\n   - The independent variable `x1` consists of planet indices.\n   - The dependent variable `y` consists of the semi-major axis values.\n   - The data shows a rapid increase of `y` as `x1` increases, indicating a likely exponential or polynomial relationship.\n\n2. **Analyzing Existing Equations**:\n   - High-complexity equations (complexity > 10) yield infinite MSE values, suggesting overfitting or invalidity.\n   - Low-complexity equations with reasonable MSE hint exponential growth: `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)`, `c[0]*exp(c[1]*(x1-c[2]))`, `c[0]*x1+c[1]*exp(c[2]*x1)`, etc.\n   - The equation `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]/(x1+c[3])` has the lowest MSE, suggesting a combination of exponential and rational functions might fit well.\n\n3. **Generating New Equations**:\n   - Aim for diversity in functional forms but stay within reasonable complexity to avoid overfitting or high MSE.\n   - Consider exponential, polynomial, and rational forms due to data pattern and previous results.\n\n4. **Constraints and Ideas**:\n   - Use exponential expressions due to rapid growth in `y`.\n   - Explore rational forms to incorporate potential asymptotic behavior.\n   - Consider combining polynomial and exponential terms for flexibility in fitting.\n\n5. **Potential New Equations**:\n   - Exponential and rational: `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)/(c[2]+x1)`\n   - Polynomial and exponential mix for rapid growth: `c[0]*x1^2 + c[1]*exp(c[2]*x1)`\n   - Combined linear-exponential: `c[0]*x1*exp(c[1]*x1)`",
