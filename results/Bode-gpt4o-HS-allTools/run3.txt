The values of y increase rapidly, indicating a possible exponential or polynomial relationship.\n\n2. At x1 = 0, y = 0.72. If we consider any expression, it should approximately pass through this point.\n\n3. At x1 = 1, y = 1. This could suggest a linear or square relationship. However, the rapid increase for larger x1 suggests higher-degree terms or exponential growth.\n\n4. Checking if polynomial fits:\n\n   - Linear (c0 + c1*x1): Not likely due to rapid y increase.\n   - Quadratic (c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2): Possible, but higher degree might be needed.\n   - Cubic (c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2 + c3*x1^3): More likely due to rapid growth.\n\n5. Checking if exponential fits:\n\n   - Exponential (c0 * exp(c1*x1)): Could fit due to rapid increase, especially after x1 = 3.\n   \n6. Logarithmic doesn't fit because y values don't grow logarithmically with x1.\n\n7. Suggested approach: Try combinations of polynomial and exponential functions.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nTo suggest three new equations, we need to identify patterns from the dataset and the previous suggestions. The current Pareto front shows a clear preference for exponential functions when dealing with the dataset. Exponential functions seem to fit well with the independent variable x1, particularly given the rapid increase in the dependent variable y.\n\n1. The equation `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)` with complexity 6 and MSE of 0.06324868 is one of the simplest and most effective models. We need to find something different from this but with similar low complexity and MSE.\n\n2. The equation `c[0]*exp(c[1]*x1)+c[2]` with complexity 8 and MSE of 0.0068813 adds a constant term which slightly improves the fit. An additive term can help improve the fit, so considering other additive forms may be beneficial.\n\n3. Polynomial forms are also considered, but they seem to have higher MSEs, like `c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1**2` with MSE of 7.81677557. However, exploring other polynomial combinations might still be worthwhile.\n\n4. A logarithmic function might capture the trend, especially for large x1 values, but it was not previously explored. It's worth testing given the rapid growth rate of y.\n\nTo ensure diverse suggestions, I will consider:\n- A novel polynomial form, potentially incorporating squares or cubes.\n- A mixed form that combines polynomial and exponential components.\n- An exploration of logarithmic or square root forms for capturing growth trends.\n\nLet's generate the new equations:\n\n1.
