  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the dataset, we can see that the relationship between the dependent variable y and the independent variable x1 is a nonlinear relationship. The values of y increase as the values of x1 increase, but the rate of increase slows down as x1 gets larger. This suggests a rational function might be a good fit for the data. \n\nThe equations provided in the Pareto front all have relatively low complexity and MSE, but there's room for improvement. We are looking for equations that are simpler yet still accurate, which means maintaining a low MSE while reducing the complexity.\n\nLet's start with the simplest rational function, which is just y = c0/x1. This has a complexity of 3, which is lower than any of the equations currently in the Pareto front. However, it may not be accurate enough, as it doesn't account for any shifts or scaling in the data.\n\nTo account for shifts in the data, we can add a constant to the denominator, giving us y = c0/(x1 + c1). This increases the complexity to 5, but it may also improve the accuracy.\n\nFinally, we can try scaling the x1 variable before dividing, which gives us y = c0/(c1*x1). This also has a complexity of 5, but it might fit the data better if there's a scaling factor involved.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the given dataset and the Pareto front of equations, it seems that the data has a reciprocal relationship with the independent variable (x1). This is evident from the equations in the Pareto front, where most of the best-fitting equations have x1 in the denominator.

However, it's quite complex with both addition and division operations. The simplest equation (complexity of 3) has a much higher MSE of 1.30927801, indicating a poor fit to the data.\n\nIn order to suggest new equations, we need to come up with different forms that balance both complexity and fit. We also need to ensure that these new equations are not 'SR-similar' to the already existing equations. This means coming up with entirely different forms, not just flipping signs or consolidating constants.\n\nGiven the restrictions of using only basic operators (+, -, *, and /) and no complex unary operators, and also not fitting constants, it limits the number of possible forms of equations we can suggest.
