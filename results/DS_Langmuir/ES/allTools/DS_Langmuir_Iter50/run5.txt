This narrows down my options to expressions that involve different combinations of these operations.\n\nTo generate diverse models, I will consider different operations and their combinations. I will take into account that the model should be as simple as possible, but also accurate. Therefore, I will experiment with adding and subtracting terms, as well as multiplying and dividing by x1. \n\nSince the data is increasing, I will also consider expressions where x1 is multiplied by itself or divided by itself, as these operations can result in increasing patterns. \n\nI will avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions to the ones provided in the Pareto front.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the given dataset and previous equations, it appears that a common theme is the use of division. The dataset shows an increase of the dependent variable 'y' as the independent variable 'x1' increases, suggesting some sort of proportionality between the two. However, the increase is not linear as 'y' increases at a decelerating rate as 'x1' increases. This suggests that the relationship could be a rational function where 'x1' is in the denominator. \n\nConsidering the restrictions, and the fact that the best performing equations in the Pareto front are all rational functions, it would be beneficial to explore more rational functions but with different structures to enhance diversity. \n\nWe should avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions to the ones in the Pareto front.

The data shows a trend where the dependent variable y increases with an increase in x1. The rate of increase appears to slow down as x1 increases, suggesting a possible saturation point.\n2. The two equations with the lowest Mean Squared Error (mse) are \"c[0]/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]\" and \"c[0]*(c[1]+x1)/(c[2]+x1)\" both with mse of 0.00117965.

The equation with the lowest complexity is \"c[0]*x1+c[1]\" with a complexity of 5, but it has a relatively high mse of 0.03418604.\n4. There is an equation with a complexity of 7 \"c[0]*c[1]*x1+c[2]\" which has the same mse as the equation with the lowest complexity.
