Still, it's worth considering, especially as a starting point for more complex equations. \n\nThe next equations are based on the observation that the data might follow a sort of saturation curve, where the dependent variable (y) increases quickly at first and then slows down as x1 increases. This kind of behavior can often be captured by a function of the form y = c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1), which is known as a Michaelis-Menten or saturation curve. This curve is often used in chemistry and biology to model situations where a process starts off quickly and then slows down as it approaches a maximum.\n\nThe last equation is a little more complex, but it might provide a better fit to the data. It's of the form y = c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1) + c[2]*x1, which combines a saturation curve with a linear term.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad: \nLooking at the Pareto front, we can see that the mean squared error (mse) increases as the complexity decreases. This implies that as we reduce the number of terms in the equation, the model's ability to fit the data decreases. The goal is to find new equations that strike a balance between complexity and accuracy, while also providing diversity.\n\nGiven the restrictions, we can generate new expressions by recombining the terms in the existing equations in unique ways, or by introducing new terms that are within the allowed operations. We need to ensure that these new expressions are not 'SR-similar' to the existing ones.\n\nFor the first equation, we can take the second term of the most complex equation and combine it with the first term of the least complex equation.
