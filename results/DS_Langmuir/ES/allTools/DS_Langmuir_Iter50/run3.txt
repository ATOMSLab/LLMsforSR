Since these operators are not permissible, we can attempt to mimic such behavior with more creative use of our permissible operators.\n\nGiven equations involve simple polynomial terms and ratios. To create diversity, we can think of complex combinations of these operators. However, we must also keep the complexity low. \n\n1. A possible way to introduce a sort of pseudo-logarithmic behavior is to divide a linear term by a quadratic term, which would yield an equation of the form: c0/(x1+c1) + c2. This could potentially mimic the rapidly increasing behavior at low x1 values and the slow increase at high x1 values. \n\n2. Another potential equation could involve a quadratic term in the numerator and a linear term in the denominator, such as c0*x1**2/(x1+c1) + c2. This would still yield a polynomial behavior but the rate of increase would be controlled by the linear term in the denominator.\n\n3. Finally, we could try a simple multiplication of linear and quadratic terms, such as c0*x1*(x1+c1) + c2. This would yield a cubic behavior but with a different weight distribution compared to a standard cubic polynomial.\n\nThese three suggested equations are significantly different from the given equations and hence, are not SR-similar.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the provided Pareto front, it seems the equations tend to have a structure where x1 is in the denominator, likely indicating a relationship of the form y = c0/(f(x1) + c1) + c2, where f is a function of x1.\n\nThe complexity of the equations varies from 7 to 11, and the mean squared error (mse) ranges from approximately 0.00117965 to 0.07727858. The equation with the highest complexity (11) and lowest mse (0.00117965) is \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1+c[2])+c[3]\". Meanwhile, the equation with the lowest complexity (7) and highest mse (0.07119782) is \"c[0]/(x1+x1)+c[1]\". \n\nTaking into account the restrictions and avoiding SR-similarity, I'll suggest new equations that manipulate the complexity while trying to maintain a low mse. \n\n1. Since the lowest complexity equation seems to be of form c0/(f(x1) + c1) + c2, I'll suggest a variation of this by changing the function of x1 from simple linear to quadratic.\n\n2.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Reviewing the provided dataset and the Pareto front of accuracy and complexity, it is clear that all the equations are variations of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model that is commonly used in enzyme kinetics and adsorption isotherms. \n\nThe Michaelis-Menten model's basic expression is c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1), which is present in the Pareto front but with a higher level of complexity due to additional constants and transformations. \n\nThe goal is to propose new equations that are not SR-similar to the existing ones and that continue to adhere to the basic structure of the Michaelis-Menten model. \n\nWhile complexity must be minimized, the new equations should also be diverse and provide good fits to the data.

The provided analysis confirms this, with the best fitting functions being rational expressions involving division by x1 or x1^2.\n\nHowever, the dataset also has a clear upward trend, suggesting that a simple linear function might also provide a good fit. This is confirmed by the fact that the linear function \"c[0]*x1 + c[1]\" has a relatively low mean squared error despite its low complexity.\n\nGiven these observations, and the restrictions on the types of functions we can suggest, it would be a good idea to explore functions that combine these two types of behavior.
