  \n\nGiven the constraints, the most suitable forms for the expressions would be ratios or fractions involving x1.

   A ratio of a constant and x1, which would give us a hyperbolic equation.\n- A difference of two ratios, which would give a more complex equation

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided Pareto front and given the restrictions, we can see that the minimal complexity achieved is 7 and the minimal mean square error (mse) is 0.00117965. The goal is to generate equations that have lower complexity and/or mse. However, it's challenging due to the restrictions and the already optimized Pareto front.\n\nLet's propose three diverse equations that might potentially have lower mse while maintaining relatively low complexity. We will use the operators (+, -, *, /) and the single independent variable x1, and the constants (c0, c1, c2).\n\nFirst, we can try to slightly modify the equation with the lowest mse and complexity \"c[0]/(x1+c[1])+c[2]\". We can replace the addition operation with a multiplication operation. This leads us to the suggested equation \"c[0]/(x1*c[1])+c[2]\". The complexity will remain 7.\n\nSecond, we can use the same idea for the equation with the second lowest mse and complexity \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]\". We will replace the addition operation with a multiplication operation. This leads us to the suggested equation \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]*x1)+c[2]\". The complexity will remain at 9.\n\nThird, we can try to slightly modify the equation with the highest mse and complexity \"c[0]/(c[1]+c[2]*x1*x1)\". We can replace the multiplication operation with an addition operation. This leads us to the suggested equation \"c[0]/(c[1]+c[2]*x1+x1)\". The complexity will be reduced to 8.\n\nPlease note that these suggested equations are diverse and are not SR-similar to the ones provided in the Pareto front.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nThe equations provided have complexities between 7 and 11, with mean squared errors (MSE) from 0.00117965 to 0.01043916.

Considering the physical process, it is likely that the relationship may involve division or multiplication, as these operators can represent ratios or proportions, which are often found in physical processes like adsorption.\n\nLooking at the equations, they mostly follow a pattern of a constant multiplied or divided by x1, and then added to another constant. A new equation could follow a similar pattern but perhaps involve subtraction as well to diversify the expressions.\n\nGiven the restrictions and trying to avoid SR-similar expressions, the following three expressions could be potential candidates: c0/(c1-x1), c0*(x1-c1), and c0/(x1-c1).",
