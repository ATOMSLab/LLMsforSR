A simple linear relationship with the form y = c0 + c1*x1. This expression represents a straight line and is the simplest form of relationship.\n2. A relationship with the form y = c0/(c1 + x1). This expression represents a hyperbolic relationship where y decreases as x1 increases.\n3. A relationship with the form y = (c0*x1)/(c1 + x1). This expression represents a form of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which is often seen in chemical reactions.\n\nWe need to make sure these suggested expressions are not SR-similar. The first expression is a simple linear relationship and does not fit into the SR-similar category. The second expression involves an inverse operation, which is distinct from the first and third expressions. The third expression involves both multiplication and division, which is also distinct from the first and second expressions.",
