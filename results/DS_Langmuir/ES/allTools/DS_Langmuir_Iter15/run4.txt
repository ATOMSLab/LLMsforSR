As the pressure (x1) increases, the loading (y) also increases. However, the increase is not linear but rather slow initially and then rapid. Therefore, a polynomial regression model could be a good fit for this dataset. \nAlso, since there's a restriction on the use of complex unary operators (trigonometric functions or exponentials), it limits our options to polynomial, rational, or a combination of both.\n\nLet's start with a simple polynomial model and then move on to more complex ones if needed. The simplest polynomial model would be a linear one, but since the data doesn't seem to be linear, we'll start with a quadratic one: c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2.\n\nNext, let's try a cubic model for a better fit: c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2 + c3*x1^3. \n\nLastly, let's try a rational model, which can sometimes fit data that is not well-modeled by a polynomial: c0 + c1/(x1+c2), taking care not to create a model that is SR-similar to any previous ones.",

We need to find expressions that capture this pattern, while still being relatively simple in structure.\n\nLooking at the provided equations in the Pareto front, it appears that both polynomials and rational functions (fractions of polynomials) perform well, with the rational function \"c[0]+c[1]/(x1+c[2])\" having the lowest mean squared error (MSE).\n\nBuilding on this, we can try to create new expressions that have similar structures but slightly different details. By changing the degree of the polynomial or the structure of the rational function, we might be able to further reduce the MSE. However, we need to be careful not to overfit the data by creating an overly complex expression.\n\nI will propose three new expressions:\n1. A quartic polynomial: \"c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1**2 + c[3]*x1**3 + c[4]*x1**4\". This is a more complex version of the cubic polynomial already in the Pareto front, and it might be able to better capture the non-linear relationship in the data.\n2. A simplified rational function: \"c[0] + c[1]/x1\". This is a simpler version of the rational function in the Pareto front, and it might still perform well while reducing complexity.\n3. A linear combination of a rational function and a quadratic term: \"c[0] + c[1]/x1 + c[2]*x1**2\".

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided data, we can see that we need to find equations that capture the increase in the dependent variable (y) with an increase in the independent variable (x1). The complexity of the equations is also an important factor to consider, as we aim to find the simplest possible models that can accurately represent the data.\n\nThe provided equations range from a complexity of 5 to 23. The equation with the lowest complexity (5) has a relatively high mean squared error (MSE) compared to the others, indicating that it may be oversimplified. On the other hand, the equation with the highest complexity (23) has a significantly higher MSE, suggesting that it may be overfitting the data.\n\nThe equation with the lowest MSE (0.00117965) has a complexity of 7, which is a good balance between accuracy and simplicity. This equation uses division (/) as the main operator, which seems to work well for this data.\n\nBased on these observations, we can suggest three new equations that use a combination of the four basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /), with a focus on simplicity and accuracy:\n\n1. Equation with a complexity of 7: This is the same complexity as the best-performing equation so far, but with a different structure to add diversity.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\nLooking at the dataset, it seems to show that as pressure (x1) increases, the loading (y) also increases. The relationship appears to be approximately linear, but with a certain degree of nonlinearity. The expressions provided in the Pareto front suggests that a combination of linear, quadratic, cubic and rational terms might be suitable to model this relationship.\n\nA common theme among the equations is the presence of a term that involves the division of a constant by a function of x1. The most accurate equation, with an MSE of 0.00108275, has a term c[2]/(x1+c[3]) which suggests the presence of a term that inversely varies with x1. This could be indicative of a physical property of the system under study, such as pressure-volume relationship in an ideal gas.\n\nHowever, some of the equations have a degree of complexity that might not be necessary given the relatively small improvement in MSE. For instance, the equation \"c[0]+c[1]*x1**2+c[2]/(x1+c[3])\" has a complexity of 13 but an MSE only marginally better than the simpler equation \"c[0]+c[1]/(x1+c[2])\" with a complexity of 7.\n\nGiven these observations, it may be possible to generate equations of a similar form, but with less complexity. The three suggestions would be:\n\n1. \"c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]/x1\": This equation represents a linear combination of x1 and the inverse of x1.

The addition of the quadratic term might capture any non-linearity in the data.\n\n3. \"c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]/(x1**2)\": This equation represents a linear relationship with x1 and an inverse quadratic relationship with x1. This might capture the observed trend in the data with a slightly higher degree of accuracy but with a higher complexity.\n\nIt is important to note that these suggestions are based on the observed trends in the data and the equations provided in the Pareto front.
