The objective is to propose 3 new equations that minimize both complexity and mse. \n\nObserving the current Pareto front, the equation with the lowest complexity and mse is \"c[0]*x1+c[1]\". This is a simple linear relationship between x1 and y. The equation with the highest complexity and mse is \"c[0]/(x1*x1)+c[1]\", which is an inverse quadratic relationship between x1 and y.\n\nOne approach might be to suggest equations that modify these existing relationships slightly, but in a way that might achieve a better balance between complexity and mse. Another approach might be to suggest completely new types of relationships that have not been explored yet in the current set of equations.\n\nGiven that the dataset pertains to isobutane adsorbing onto silicalite at constant temperature, and the independent variable (x1) is pressure, it might be reasonable to hypothesize that the relationship between pressure and loading could be a combination of linear and inverse relationships.
