This indicates a certain form of saturation or limiting behaviour.\n\nWe can consider using simple polynomial forms, inverse forms and their combinations to capture this behaviour. \n\nWe also need to ensure that we avoid SR-similar expressions as they would be redundant. For instance, expressions such as c0*x1, c0*x1+c1, and x1/c0 would be considered SR-similar as they can be simplified to a single constant multiple of x1.\n\nPossible expressions to consider could include:\n1) A simple linear term like c0*x1 to capture the initial rise.\n2) An inverse term like c0/(x1+c1) to capture the saturation behaviour.\n3) A combination like c0*x1/(c1 + x1) which could capture both initial rise and subsequent saturation.\n\nRemember, the constants c0, c1, etc. will be fitted to the data and are placeholders for actual values.

The data seems to show a curvilinear relationship between the independent variable (x1) and the dependent variable (y), which might explain why the model with the lowest MSE and complexity is a linear model. \n\nGiven the nature of the experiment (isobutane adsorbing onto silicalite at constant temperature), the pressure (x1) might have a direct relationship with the loading (y). However, the nature of this relationship is non-linear, and it is expected that as the pressure increases, the loading also increases but at a decreasing rate.\n\nConsidering the above inference, we can propose several non-linear models that describe this relationship and satisfy the restrictions given.
