We can try to reduce its complexity while trying to maintain its accuracy. \n\nFor example, we could remove the constant subtracted at the end: \"c[0]/(c[1]+x1)\" or we can switch the position of the constants and variable in the denominator: \"c[0]/(x1+c[1])\". These are simple changes that might reduce complexity without greatly increasing the mse.\n\nAnother option could be to multiply the variable by a constant instead of dividing by it: \"c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)\". \n\nLastly, we might try a combination of addition and multiplication operations, which often tend to have lower complexity: \"c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1\".\n\nThese suggestions are made on the basis of the data and equations given, and the actual performance of these equations will have to be verified by testing them on the data.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Here is my analysis of the dataset:\n\nFrom the dataset and the Pareto front of complexity and mean squared error (MSE), we can observe that the best performing equations are those that include both x1 and the constants c[0], c[1], and sometimes c[2] in a fractional form. The complexity of the equations ranges from 5 to 9, and the MSE ranges from 0.00117965 to 0.12910906. \n\nHowever, the equations with the lowest MSE have higher complexity and vice versa. This highlights the trade-off between complexity and accuracy (lower MSE). We should aim for equations with relatively low complexity and low MSE to ensure that the model is not overfitted and can generalize well to new data. \n\nLooking at the Pareto front, we can see that the equations with the lowest complexity (5) are \"c[0]*x1+c[1]\" and \"c[0]/(x1+c[1])\" with MSE of 0.03418604 and 0.11971242 respectively. However, the equation with the lowest MSE (0.00117965) is \"c[0]/(c[1]+x1)-c[2]\" with a complexity of 7. \n\nIn terms of the structure of the equations, we can see that there is a mixture of equations where x1 is in the numerator or denominator, and the constants are either added or subtracted. Therefore, when suggesting new equations, we should consider both forms to potentially find a better fitting and less complex equation.\n\nTo avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions, we should consider using different combinations of operators and the position of x1 and the constants in the equation.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the Pareto front analysis, it is clear that there is a trade-off between the complexity of the equations and the mean squared error (mse). \n\nThe most accurate equation is also the most complex, with a complexity of 11 and an mse of 0.00108049. This equation involves both addition and division operations, with the x1 variable appearing in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe least complex equation, with a complexity of 5, has a significantly higher mse of 0.03418604. This equation only involves addition and multiplication operations, which suggests that the inclusion of division operations may help to improve the fit of the model.\n\nBased on this analysis, we may consider creating new equations that maintain a balance between complexity and accuracy. Specifically, we may consider using a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, with the x1 variable appearing in both the numerator and the denominator. \n\nTo maintain diversity and avoid redundancy, we should also avoid creating equations that are 'SR-similar' to the existing ones. This means that we should avoid creating equations that can be transformed into one another by simply changing the sign of a constant or by combining constants into a single fitted constant.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the provided equations and their complexity, we can see that there's a wide range of complexity from 5 to 11. The mean squared error also varies significantly, from as low as 0.00108049 to as high as 0.04670168. \n\nFrom the given dataset, we can infer that the relationship between the dependent and independent variable is not straightforward and may involve some form of nonlinear relationship. The provided equations also confirm this. \n\nConsidering the constraints, we need to propose equations that are diverse and have minimized complexity and loss. The equations should involve the four basic operations and can use constants represented by c0, c1, etc. \n\nThe equations I will propose will try to capture the nonlinear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.
