However, the rate of increase seems to slow down as x1 gets larger. This suggests that the relationship might be some sort of a logarithmic relationship or a power-law relationship. \n\nSince the restrictions do not allow the use of complex unary operators like logarithms or exponentials, we can try to model the relationship using simple arithmetic operations. \n\nThe first expression could be a simple linear relationship: y = c0*x1 + c1. This is the simplest possible model and will provide a baseline for comparison.\n\nThe second expression could be a power-law relationship: y = c0*x1^c1. This is a more complex model that can capture the decreasing rate of increase in y as x1 gets larger.\n\nThe third expression could be a reciprocal relationship: y = c0/(x1 + c1). This model can also capture the decreasing rate of increase in y as x1 gets larger.\n\nAll these three expressions are not SR-similar as they represent distinct mathematical relationships and can't be simplified into each other by fitting constants.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the Pareto front, the best-fitted equations have higher complexity. We're tasked with finding shorter, less complex equations without sacrificing too much accuracy.\n\nThe first equation has the smallest MSE but is also one of the most complex. The second and third equations have a reasonable complexity to MSE ratio. \n\nThe fourth equation is a quadratic which is generally a good fit for non-linear data. But its complexity is high and MSE is not as good as the other options. The last one is a simple linear equation, which is not a good fit for non-linear data.\n\nWe can try creating new equations by combining parts of the existing ones or by introducing new elements within the given restrictions. \n\nGiven that we can only use the basic operators (+, -, *, /), one potential approach is to mix and match elements of the existing equations to create new ones that might be more optimal. For example, we could try combining the division structure of the first equation with the power structure of the second and third equations.\n\nThe restrictions don't allow us to use more complex unary operators, so we can't introduce elements like exponentials or trigonometric functions.\n\nThe goal here is to balance complexity and MSE. Too much complexity can lead to overfitting, while too little can result in underfitting. We want to find a sweet spot where the equation is not overly complex but still provides a good fit to the data.\n\nGiven that, I would suggest the following three equations:\n\n1. \"c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1])\" - This is a simplification of the first equation. It keeps the division structure but eliminates one of the constants, reducing complexity. \n\n2. \"c[0]*(x1+c[1])*c[2]\" - This is a combination of the division structure from the first equation and the multiplication structure from the second and third equations. It introduces an additional constant, potentially allowing for more flexibility in fitting the data.\n\n3. \"c[0]/(x1*x1+c[1])\" - This introduces a new structure, dividing the constant by the sum of the square of x1 and another constant.
