  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the dataset, it seems like the relationship between x1 and y is non-linear.

However, given the non-linear nature of the relationship, I would suggest trying to find equations with a bit more complexity that can represent non-linear relationships better, while still trying to keep the complexity as low as possible.\n\nSince we can only use the four basic operators (+, -, *, /), a good way to introduce non-linearity might be to use these operators to combine x1 and the constants in different ways. For example, we could try multiplying or dividing x1 by a constant, or adding or subtracting a constant from x1. We could also try combining these operations, for example by multiplying x1 by a constant and then adding or subtracting another constant.\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind is that we should avoid suggesting SR-similar expressions.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Looking at the provided dataset and existing equations, it seems that the equations are primarily based on the division and multiplication operations.

To this end, I propose the following expressions:\n\n1. \"c[0]*x1+c[1]\": This is a simple linear expression with just two terms and two parameters.
