However, since complex unary operations like logarithms and exponentials are not allowed, we are limited to the basic arithmetic operations. \n\nWe need to ensure the expressions are not SR-similar, so we must be careful not to construct expressions that can be reduced to the same form by constant fitting. \n\nThe simplest potential relationship might be direct proportionality, which is represented by y = c0 * x1. \n\nA more complex relationship could involve a ratio of two polynomials. For example, we might suggest an expression like y = (c0*x1 + c1) / (x1 + c1). \n\nAnother possibility could be a quadratic relationship of the form y = c0*x1^2. However, since we are not allowed to use exponentials, we can approximate it by multiplication of x1 with itself, y = c0*x1*x1.",

This suggests that the relationship between the two variables might be represented by a simple linear or polynomial equation. However, the restrictions on the use of operators and the absence of other complex unary operators like trigonometric functions or exponentials limit the types of equations that can be suggested.\n\nThe dataset also doesn't seem to exhibit any obvious patterns that could be exploited to create a more complex equation with a lower mse. Therefore, the challenge would be to find a simple equation that can accurately represent the relationship between the two variables.\n\nWhen suggesting new equations, it's important to note that they should not be SR-similar to the existing equations to avoid redundancy. This means that the new equations should not be equivalent to the existing ones after fitting constants to the data. For example, - c0/(x1-c1) & c0/(x1+c1) are SR-similar because the sign of a constant can be absorbed after fitting.",
