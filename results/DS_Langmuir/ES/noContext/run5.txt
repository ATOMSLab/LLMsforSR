However, since we can't use logarithms, we'll have to use the operations (+, -, *, /) to mimic this relationship via polynomial and rational functions.\n\nLet's start with a simple linear relationship: y = c0 + c1*x1. This may not capture the pattern perfectly, but it's a start.\n\nNext, consider a quadratic form: y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*(x1^2). This should better account for the non-linear relationship between x1 and y.\n\nLastly, a rational function might be useful: y = c0 + c1/(x1+c2). This is because the behavior of y appears to resemble a function with a vertical asymptote, which is a characteristic of rational functions.",

Most of the previous equations involve rational functions with x1 and constants in the numerator and/or denominator. However, the data does not seem to follow a simple linear or polynomial relationship, suggesting that the relationship could be more complex.\n\nFor the new suggestions, I can explore different combinations of x1 and constants in the numerator and denominator. The challenge is to keep the complexity low while maintaining a high level of accuracy, as measured by the mean square error (MSE). \n\nLooking at the previous equations, I can see that the ones with the lowest MSE have a complexity of 7 or more. There are a few different ways to achieve this complexity level, such as by including x1 in both the numerator and denominator or by including a constant in the numerator and a combination of x1 and constants in the denominator.\n\nGiven the constraints, I should avoid creating equations that are SR-similar to the ones already suggested. This means I should not simply change the sign of constants or consolidate constants into one fitted constant. Instead, I should aim to create fundamentally different equations.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I can suggest three new equations. All of them will involve different combinations of x1 and constants in the numerator and denominator, with the goal of achieving a balance between accuracy and complexity.",

We can place the x1 term in the numerator along with a constant, and the denominator can be a combination of constants: \"c[0] + (c[1]*x1)/(c[2]+c[3])\"\n\n2.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nAnalyzing the dataset, we can see that the dependent variable y increases as the independent variable x1 increases. The rate of increase seems to be decreasing as x1 increases, which suggests some form of diminishing return.\n\nThe proposed equations from the Pareto front also suggest some form of rational function (a ratio of polynomials), where the denominator increases with x1, which would result in a decreasing rate of increase for y.\n\nTo propose new equations, I will try to maintain this rational form while varying the complexity and ensuring diversity from the previous equations. The complexity of an equation can be decreased by reducing the number of terms or operators, and increased by adding more terms or operators. Diversity can be ensured by varying the structure of the equation and the combination of operators.\n\nGiven these considerations, I propose the following three equations:\n\n1. \"c[0] + c[1]/(x1 + x1*c[2])\": This equation maintains the rational form and introduces an additional multiplication in the denominator to increase the complexity. The multiplication of x1 by c[2] before addition to x1 in the denominator introduces another level of non-linearity.\n\n2. \"c[0] + c[1]*x1/(c[2] + x1)\": This equation introduces a multiplication of x1 by c[1] in the numerator, which could help capture any linear dependence of y on x1.
