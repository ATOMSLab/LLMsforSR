  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nLooking at the given data, it appears that the relationship between x1 (pressure) and y (loading) is non-linear, showing a trend that resembles either a saturation curve or a polynomial relationship. \n\n1. Initial analysis hints at a logarithmic or saturation-type curve due to the fast initial rise that tapers off. However, since exponential or logarithmic functions are not allowed, we should consider polynomial or rational functions.\n\n2. A simple polynomial fit such as y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2 might capture the general trend of the data, but this might not fully capture the saturation behavior unless higher-order terms are involved.\n\n3. Rational functions (ratios of polynomials) can capture saturation behavior effectively. A simple form could be y = (c0*x1) / (c1 + x1), which starts with a direct proportional increase but levels off as x1 increases, mimicking saturation.\n\n4. Another potential rational fit could be y = (c0 * x1^2) / (c1 + x1^2), which might allow for a more pronounced saturation effect as x1 increases.",

A rational function with a quadratic denominator might fit well given the observed saturation, but to avoid SR-similarity, we need to be creative in structuring the expression.\n\n7. Exploring simple polynomial functions with both linear and inverse terms could offer new insights into the balance between complexity and mse.\n\nPotential New Expressions:\n\n1. c0 + c1 * x1 / (c2 + x1 * x1) - This introduces a quadratic term in the denominator, which hasn't been directly explored in the given equations.\n\n2. (c0 + c1 * x1) / (c2 + x1) + c3 / (x1 + c4) - This combines both a rational function and an inverse term to capture potential complex behaviors at different pressure ranges.\n\n3. c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1) - c2 * x1 / (c3 + x1 * x1) - A difference of two rational functions, potentially capturing a more nuanced saturation effect through a subtraction mechanism.",
