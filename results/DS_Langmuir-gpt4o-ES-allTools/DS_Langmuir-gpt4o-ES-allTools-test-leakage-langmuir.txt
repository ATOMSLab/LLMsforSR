      ...Scratch Pad:- The relationship between pressure and loading in adsorption could follow a non-linear trend.
  Observing the dataset, the loading (y) increases with pressure (x1), starting from a slower rise and becoming steeper as x1 increases.
  The trend suggests a form of saturation or limit, common in adsorption processes. This hints at a potential Langmuir or Freundlich-like 
  isotherm without the use of exponents or logarithms. 
  We notice that as x1 increases, y seems to approach a limiting value. 
  - One approach could be to use a fraction that balances increase in both numerator and denominator as x1 increases.
  - Another approach could involve using an inverse function, as these often help model saturation behavior.
  - A linear term might not capture the non-linear increase adequately but could serve as a baseline expression.
- 
  We'll develop a few expressions that match these characteristics....

First, let's observe the trend of the dataset. 
  From the x1 and y pairs, it seems like the relationship is non-linear and might be saturating 
  as x1 increases. This suggests a possible rational expression form like y = (a * x1) / (b + x1) 
  which is inspired by the Langmuir isotherm used in adsorption processes.

Let's try different 
  potential expressions and see how they might fit the data:

  A simple linear fit, for the sake of comparison:

This behavior is often modeled by Langmuir isotherms or similar rational functions.

   However, its MSE is quite high.

- The second equation, `(c[0]*x1)/(c[1]+x1**0.5)+c[2]`, introduces a square root transformation,

  - Freundlich isotherm involves a power law, which isn't allowed here. 


  5. Given the restrictions, we need to focus on rational functions, polynomials, and simple combinations thereof.


  6. Ideas for new equations:
   
  - A polynomial form not exceeding third order, but different from previously given cubic polynomial.
  
   - A rational function with a quadratic numerator or denominator.
   
   - A combination of linear and rational components, ensuring they are not similar to existing equations.

1. The dataset describes the relationship between pressure and loading, which is typically non-linear. Commonly used forms for modeling adsorption include Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms.
2. The provided equations demonstrate various forms including polynomials and rational functions. The most accurate one is: 'c[0]+x1/(c[1]+x1)-c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1*x1)', having a complexity of 17 and an MSE of 0.00010984.
3. The goal is to come up with equations that strike a balance between complexity and loss without being SR-similar to existing ones.
4. For diversity, consider structures like:

1. We have seven existing equations with varying complexities and mean squared errors (MSE). The goal is to suggest new equations with minimized complexity and MSE.
2. The dataset is a typical adsorption isotherm, which often follows a type of Langmuir or Freundlich isotherm, suggesting forms like y = x/(a + x) or y = ax/(b + x).
3. Consider the existing equations:
   - Polynomial: y = c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1^2 + c[3]*x1^3 (complex, higher MSE)
   - Rational (Langmuir-like): y = c[0] + x1/(c[1] + x1) (simple, lower MSE)
   - Combination: adding terms or using division to manage complexity and fit.
4. Avoid SR-similar forms:
   - Avoid simple polynomial expansions of x1 as they become similar.
   - Avoid similar rational forms with simple variations in constants.
5. New suggestions:
   a. Consider adding a quadratic term to a rational form: y = (x1^2)/(c[0] + x1)
   b. Explore a subtraction variant: y = c[0] - c[1]/(c[2] + x1)
   c. Mix polynomial and rational: y = c[0]*x1 + x1/(c[1] + x1^2)
