  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:- The relationship between pressure and loading in adsorption could follow a non-linear trend.
  Observing the dataset, the loading (y) increases with pressure (x1), starting from a slower rise and becoming steeper as x1 increases.
  The trend suggests a form of saturation or limit, common in adsorption processes. This hints at a potential Langmuir or Freundlich-like 
  isotherm without the use of exponents or logarithms. 
  We notice that as x1 increases, y seems to approach a limiting value. 
  - One approach could be to use a fraction that balances increase in both numerator and denominator as x1 increases.
  - Another approach could involve using an inverse function, as these often help model saturation behavior.
  - A linear term might not capture the non-linear increase adequately but could serve as a baseline expression.\n- 
  We'll develop a few expressions that match these characteristics.",

  The dataset describes the adsorption of isobutane onto silicalite as a function of pressure. The target is to find simple expressions that 
  fit the data well. We have an existing Pareto front with the following expressions:
  1. `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)` with a complexity of 7 and MSE of 0.04670168
  2. `(c[0]+c[1]*x1)/(c[2]+c[3]*x1)` with a complexity of 11 and MSE of 0.00117965

  4. `c[0]+(c[1]*x1)/(c[2]+x1)-c[3]*x1` with a complexity of 13 and MSE of 0.00108275
  To propose new equations, I need to balance between complexity and the goodness of fit. The candidate expressions should be different 
  from the existing ones and not SR-similar.The data shows typical saturation behavior, so hyperbolic or rational functions might be appropriate.
  However, we need to introduce variation to avoid SR-similar expressions.
  Let's consider:
  1. A rational function with an additional term:  `(c[0]*x1)/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1)`. This introduces a new term that 
  could model different saturation levels.
  2. A shifted rational function: `c[0]/(c[1] + x1) + c[2]`. It introduces a shift and different saturation behavior by shifting the hyperbola.
  3. A combination of multiplicative and additive forms: `c[0] + c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1) + c[3]*x1`. This provides a linear component with a 
  saturation term. These expressions should be sufficiently distinct from the existing ones.",

The dataset indicates a relationship where y increases as x1 increases, possibly asymptotically reaching a certain value. \n\nFrom the provided equations, the Pareto front suggests the use of rational functions (i.e., fractions) due to their capability to model asymptotic behavior and nonlinear relationships effectively. \n\n1. **Simpler Models**:\n   - We can start with models having a numerator as a linear function of x1 and a denominator as a constant plus x1. This is seen in equations like 'c[0]/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]', which has low complexity and reasonable mse.\n   \n2. **Adding Complexity**:\n   - To capture more detailed behaviors, adding more terms can improve fit at the cost of increased complexity. This is evident from equations like 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1/(c[3]+x1)+c[4]', which have better mse.\n   \n3. **Innovative Structures**:\n   - We can introduce terms that square x1 in the denominator, allowing for additional curvature to the fit. For instance, 'c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)-c[3]*x1/(c[4]+x1**2)' achieves a lower mse.\n\nConsidering these observations, let's propose three new diverse equations:\n\n1.

Consider an equation structure that might be a simple polynomial-like form to introduce diversity:\n   - `c[0] + c[1]*x1 - c[2]*x1**2`\n   - This equation introduces a quadratic term which can capture non-linearities.\n\n2.

The expressions can include linear combinations and differences of terms like `x1/(c + x1)` and `-1/(c + x1)` to maintain diversity and explore different saturation dynamics.\n\n4. Given the non-linearity and potential saturation, using a combination of terms such as `c0 + c1*x1/(c2 + x1) - c3/(c4 + x1)` or `c0*x1/(c1 + x1) + c2*x1/(c3 + x1^2)` might provide good fits while being diverse.\n\n5.

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. Analyze the existing equations with respect to their complexity and MSE:\n    - Lower complexity is better for simplicity, while lower MSE indicates better fit.\n    - The current Pareto front shows that as complexity increases, the MSE generally decreases, indicating better fit.\n\n2. Review current equations:\n    - The equation with the lowest complexity (7) and reasonable MSE (0.00117965) is: c[0]+c[1]/(c[2]+x1).\n    - The equation with the lowest MSE (0.00010791) has higher complexity (19): c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)-c[3]*x1/(c[4]+x1**2).\n\n3. Identify potential new forms:\n    - Consider forms that balance complexity and MSE. \n    - Explore forms with small modifications for better fits or reduced complexity.\n\n4. Generate diverse equations to avoid SR-similar issues:\n    - Start with combinations of linear and reciprocal terms.\n    - Investigate variations involving combinations of existing terms and simple polynomial elements without overfitting.\n\n5. New potential equations:\n    - Equation 1: c[0] + c[1]*x1/(c[2] + x1) - a simple form with linear and reciprocal term to aim for reduced complexity and decent MSE.\n    - Equation 2: c[0] + c[1]/(c[2] + x1) + c[3]*x1/(c[4] + x1) - a balanced form that combines elements of current best fits with moderate complexity.\n    - Equation 3: c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1) + c[2]/(x1 + c[3]) - a diverse form using dual fraction terms to potentially capture different aspects of the data pattern.",
