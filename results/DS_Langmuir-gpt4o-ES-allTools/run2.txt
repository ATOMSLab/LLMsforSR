  1. Analyzing the current equations:\n\n   a. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)': This equation has a higher complexity and a higher mse than some 
  other options. It suggests a hyperbolic form, like a Langmuir isotherm. However, it might not be the best fit due to its higher mse.
  b. 'c[0]*x1+c[1]': This is a simple linear equation with low complexity and mse, indicating a decent fit for the initial data points 
  but likely falling short for saturating behavior.\n\n   
  c. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]*x1': This equation adds a linear term to the hyperbolic form, reducing mse but increasing complexity. 
  It's indicative of dual adsorption sites or a combination of linear and saturating behavior.\n\n   
  d. 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)+c[2]': This equation has the lowest mse, indicating a good fit, with moderate complexity. 
  The added constant term suggests a base level of adsorption even at low pressures.\n\n2. 
  New Equation Candidates:\n\n   
  a. Start with the Langmuir form: 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)'. This is a base form for adsorption isotherms.\n\n  
  b. Consider adding another term to account for linearity: 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]*x1'. This is already one of the previous suggestions.
  c. Try a different combination of saturation and linearity, but avoiding SR-similarity. A possible option could 
  be 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1) + c[2]/x1'. This form can capture a decaying effect at higher pressures.\n\n   
  d. Explore a potential polynomial form like 'c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1**2', which introduces non-linearity without the same saturation effect, 
  though such expressions are often less fitting for adsorption data.\n\n   
  e. Consider an inverse form: 'c[0]/x1 + c[1]', to capture any possible inverse relationship, though this may not fit well given 
  the data trend.\n\n   f. Another option could be 'c[0]*x1/(c[1] + x1**2)', introducing a quadratic denominator for 
  additional curvature.\n\n3. Ensuring diversity in expressions:\n\n

For lower complexities, linear and simple rational functions seem effective, while higher complexities involve additional terms to capture finer details.\n\n3.

Lower complexity tends to have higher MSE, and vice versa.\n   - The simplest equation with low MSE is `c[0]*x1+c[1]` (complexity=5, mse=0.03418604).\n   - The most complex one with the lowest MSE is `c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)+c[3]*x1/(c[4]+x1**2)` (complexity=19, mse=0.00010791).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - We need to find new equations that are not SR-similar to the existing ones while trying to balance the complexity and the MSE.\n\n3. **Potential New Equations:**\n   - **Option 1:** Look for expressions that utilize division, addition, and multiplication in new combinations that haven't been used yet.\n   - **Option 2:** Consider forms like rational functions or nested fractions, which aren't present in the current suggestions.\n   - **Option 3:** Use combinations of simple polynomial terms with coefficients.\n\n4. **Checking for SR-similarity:**\n   - Ensure that new suggestions are not just simple transformations of existing ones (like sign changes, factor consolidations).\n\n5. **Constraints:**\n   - Ensure use of only allowed operators: +, -, *, /\n   - Use only the variable x1 and constants c0, c1, etc.\n   - Avoid SR-similar expressions.\n\n6. **Potential Suggestions:**\n   - `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1**2) + c[2]` : This form introduces a polynomial term in the denominator which hasn't been extensively used.\n   - `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1/(c[2] + x1**3)` : Combines linear with a new division aspect.\n   - `c[0]*(x1 + c[1])/(c[2] + x1**2)` : Uses a non-linear combination that adds complexity but may reduce MSE.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided Pareto front expressions to identify potential areas for innovation:\n\n1. The given expressions mostly take the form of rational functions, which are typically effective for capturing adsorption phenomena. These expressions involve terms like `x1/(c + sqrt(x1))` and `x1/(c + x1)`, indicating a focus on saturation behavior.\n\n2. The expressions with lower complexity (around 5 to 10) tend to have higher MSE, whereas the more complex ones (complexity 15 and above) have lower MSEs. This suggests a potential for finding a balanced expression with moderate complexity and low MSE.\n\n3. The terms involving `sqrt(x1)` and `x1^2` often appear in the expressions, indicating non-linear pressure dependencies which are typical in adsorption isotherms.\n\n4. Many expressions include linear terms `c0 + c1*x1`, which is a baseline model for linear adsorption.\n\n5. The expressions differ mainly in the way they handle the nonlinear saturation effects, suggesting further exploration of rational function forms.\n\nPropose New Expressions:\n\n- A simple rational form with a square root term might balance complexity and fit:\n    `c0 + c1*x1 / (c2 + sqrt(x1) + x1)`\n\n- An expression with multiple dependency terms to capture more complex behavior could be:\n    `c0 + c1*x1 / (c2 + x1) + c3*x1 / (c4 + x1**2)`\n\n- A simpler structure focusing on the main saturation feature:\n    `c0 + c1 / (c2 + x1) + c3*x1`\n\nThese expressions aim to explore different non-linear dependencies while being distinct enough from each other to avoid SR-similarity.",
