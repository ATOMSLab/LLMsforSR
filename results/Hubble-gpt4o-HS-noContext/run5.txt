The y values show a non-linear pattern that seems to have multiple phases: increasing, decreasing, and oscillating trends. This pattern suggests that the data might be modeled by polynomial-like functions or trigonometric functions, but we are limited to certain operators.\n\n2. Let's first consider polynomial expressions involving x1. A quadratic or cubic polynomial may be suitable given the oscillating nature.\n\n3. An expression of the type c0 * x1 + c1 * x1**2 + c2 * x1**3 might be a good fit because it can capture non-linear trends.\n\n4. The dataset might also involve an exponential pattern, especially as the values increase towards the latter half. An expression like c0 * exp(c1 * x1) could potentially capture this behavior.\n\n5. Logarithmic expressions could also be explored, especially for the initial slower increase in the data. An expression like c0 * log(c1 * x1 + c2) could be useful.\n\n6.
