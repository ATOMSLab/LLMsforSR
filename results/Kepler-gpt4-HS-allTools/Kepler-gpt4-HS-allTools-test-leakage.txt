Looking at the Pareto front, it is clear that the two best-fitted expressions are 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2' and 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1**3'. However, these expressions have relatively high complexity (9 and 11 respectively), and the latter also has a higher mean squared error.

The data is about planetary motion and the Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This suggests that a cubed term will likely be present in the optimal expression. 

Given the restrictions and the need to avoid SR-similar expressions, the following three expressions could be suggested:

1. 'c[0]*x1**3': A simple expression that directly applies Kepler's third law. It has low complexity but may not fit the data well.

2. 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)': This expression has low complexity and introduces a different operator (sqrt), which could potentially fit the data better.

3. 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*sqrt(x1)': This expression is a combination of the first two suggestions and introduces a new term (sqrt(x1)). It has higher complexity but might provide a better fit....

Looking at the dataset, the dependent variable (y) seems to increase non-linearly with respect to the independent variable (x1). The dataset represents the relationship between the period of planetary motion and the semi-major axis, which is governed by Kepler's third law of planetary motion. The law states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. 

The Pareto front consists of equations with different complexity and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The complexity of an equation increases with the number of operations and variables used in the equation. The MSE, on the other hand, measures the average squared differences between the estimated and actual values. Thus, a lower MSE indicates a better fitting equation.

The task is to suggest 3 new equations that minimize both the complexity and MSE. The suggested equations should be diverse and not SR-similar to the existing ones. 

Taking the restrictions into account, the new equations should include binary operators: +, -, *, / and unary operators: square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp. The equations should not fit constants but use c0, c1, etc. The equations should only include accessible independent variables from the ...

One of these laws states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Hence, we can expect a cubic relationship between the semi-major axis (x1) and the period (y). 

Looking at the currently suggested equations, the one with the least mean squared error (MSE) is 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2', but it has a complexity of 9. 

We need to suggest diverse equations with lower complexities. Also, we need to avoid SR-similar expressions, which means we should avoid using the same combinations of operators and variables.

A common power law in planetary motion is Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. So, a good starting point would be y = c0*x1^c1.

For additional expressions, possible variations could be y = c0*x1^c1 + c2, y = c0*(x1^c1 + c2), or y = c0*(x1^c1 - c2)....

As such, equations that capture this relationship should provide a good fit. 

Looking at the Pareto front, we can see a variety of expressions with varying complexity and mean squared error (mse). The simplest expression is of the form 'c[0]*x1**c[1]', with complexity 5 and mse 5.8078803. 

To diversify, we can consider variations of this form, as well as introduce other unary operators. 

For instance, we could introduce a logarithmic term which could account for the non-linear relationship between period and semi-major axis.

The complexity of the given equations ranges from 4 to 9, and the mean square error (mse) ranges from approximately 2.48 to over 3 million. Hence, we need to find equations that have a lower mse and complexity.

However, there is a significant drop in MSE between complexity 8 and 7, indicating that a complexity of 7 or lower could provide a good balance between accuracy and simplicity.

One possible approach to suggesting new equations would be to modify the existing equations in the Pareto front. For example, the equation with the lowest MSE and complexity of 7 is "c[0]*(x1**c[1]+c[2])". This equation could be modified by replacing the binary operator or changing the unary operator applied to x1.

Another approach could be to combine elements of the existing equations. For example, the equation "c[0]*x1**c[1]+log(x1)" has a relatively low MSE and could be combined with elements of other equations.

The equations should also take into account the physical context of the data. In this case, the data is about planetary motion in astrophysics.

The power relationship, i.e., raising x1 to a power, is likely to be a key factor in the equations we provide.

They will incorporate the allowed unary operators (square, cube, sqrt, log, and exp), and explore different binary operations (+, -, *, /) between them....

In the given dataset, the dependent variable y is the period of a planet's orbit, and the independent variable x1 is the semi-major axis. According to Kepler's third law, the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. So, the equation should take the form of y=c0*x1^c1 where c1 is approximately 1.5. 

Looking at the existing equations, 'c[0]*x1**c[1]', 'c[0]*(sqrt(x1))**c[1]', and 'c[0]*(x1**3)**(c[1])' all are variations of this form.

The equation 'c[0]*log(x1)' does not fit well as the mse is significantly higher and is not aligned with Kepler's third law.

To come up with diverse equations that also fit the data, we can manipulate the power of x1 and use unary operators on x1 while maintaining the relationship defined by Kepler's law....

The law states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit, meaning the relationship is of the form y ∝ x^3/2.

From the provided Pareto front, the equation with the least mean square error (MSE) is 'c[0]*(x1**2)**c[1]' with a complexity of 7. However, to minimize the complexity and maintain diversity, we need to come up with new equations.

1. c[0]*x1**1.5: This equation represents the Kepler's Third Law and is directly derived from the real-world phenomena the data represents. This equation has a complexity of 4.

2. c[0]*log(x1**2): This equation involves a logarithmic relationship with the square of the semi-major axis. This could account for any potential logarithmic scaling in the data. This equation also has a complexity of 4.

Any further increase in complexity doesn't seem to improve the MSE but will add unnecessary complexity to the model.

The semi-major axis and period relationship in planetary motion is generally described by Kepler's third law, which suggests a power-law relationship. Therefore, an equation of the form `c[0]*x1**c[1]` is highly likely to be the most accurate.

However, we are asked to suggest diverse equations. Let's try to formulate equations which are structurally different but still capture the power-law relationship. 

We need to consider the restrictions and avoid SR-similar expressions. Given that cube, sqrt, and log are allowed, we can try to incorporate them into the new equations. We need to be cautious not to suggest equations that would be deemed SR-similar. 

Expression 1: A simple square could be a good starting point - `c[0]*x1**2`.

Expression 2: We could also use the cube operation - `c[0]*x1**3`.

However, the given constraints do not allow for the use of power to non-integer numbers. 

Taking into account the equation complexity and mean squared error (MSE) from the Pareto front, the best suggestions so far are 'c[0]*(x1**2)**c[1]', 'c[0]*(sqrt(x1))**c[1]', and 'c[0]*x1**c[1]' with a complexity of 7, 6, and 5, respectively, and similar MSE.

Given that the data is about planetary motion, Kepler's third law comes to mind which states that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This gives us a hint that an expression of the form c[0]*x1**1.5 might represent the data well.

However, since the given equation is c[0]*x1**(3/2) and we are asked for diverse equations, we need to explore other possibilities for the relationship between the period and the semi-major axis, keeping in mind that the relationship is likely non-linear and increases as x1 increases.

One possibility is a simple power relationship with a different exponent, such as x1**2 or x1**3. Another possibility is to combine multiple power relationships, such as x1**2 + x1**3.
