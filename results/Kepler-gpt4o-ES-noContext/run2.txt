This suggests a non-linear relationship, possibly polynomial or rational in nature.\n   - We notice a dramatic increase in y as x1 increases, hinting at possibly quadratic or cubic terms.\n\n2. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to predict y using expressions involving x1, ensuring we adhere to the allowed operations and avoiding fitting numerical constants directly.\n   - We can explore different polynomial combinations or rational expressions that capture the pattern observed in y.\n\n3. **Expression Exploration**:\n   - The increase in y suggests trying a quadratic or cubic relationship first.\n   - Consider expressions like c0 * x1^2, c1 * x1^3, etc.\n   - Also consider rational expressions such as c0 / x1, c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1), as they might capture non-linear relationships.\n\n4. **Potential Expressions**:\n   - Start with simpler forms and then see if more complex terms are necessary.\n   - y = c0 * x1^2 might be a good starting point to capture the rapid increase.\n   - y = c0 * x1^3 could capture higher non-linearity if required.\n   - Rational forms like y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1) could be tested to see if they fit better.\n\n5. **Constraints**:\n   - Avoid fitting constants directly.

We need to devise new equations that are diverse, have minimal complexity, and low mean squared error (MSE).\n\n2. Analyzing the Pareto front:\n   - The equation `c[0]*x1**2` has the lowest complexity (5) but a high MSE of 232415.8720769.\n   - The equation `c[0]*x1**(3/2)+c[1]` has a complexity of 9 and a low MSE of 36.88681068.\n   - The equation `c[0]*x1*sqrt(x1)+c[1]*x1` with complexity 10 and MSE 13.70469374 is notable for its low MSE.\n\n3. We want to propose diverse equations that do not resemble the existing ones too closely (avoiding SR-similarity).\n\n4. The complexity of equations should be balanced with their MSE. Lower complexity is preferred if MSE is only slightly higher.\n\n5. Considering the operators allowed (+, -, *, /, sqrt()), we can explore combining them in unique ways with the variable x1 to ensure diversity.\n\n6. Some potential structures to explore:\n   - Incorporate division in a unique way, e.g., `c[0]*x1/(c[1]+sqrt(x1))`.\n   - Try a combination of square root and polynomial terms, e.g., `c[0]*sqrt(x1)+c[1]*x1**2`.\n   - A mix of linear and square root terms, e.g., `c[0]*(x1+sqrt(x1))`.\n\n7. Aim for simplicity and novelty while considering that expressions should provide a reasonable fit to the data.",
