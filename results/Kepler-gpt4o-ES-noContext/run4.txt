Analyzing the pattern in the dataset:\n   - Given y values are [87.77, 224.7, 365.25, 686.95, 4332.62, 10759.2]\n   - Given x1 values are [0.389, 0.724, 1.0, 1.524, 5.2, 9.51]\n   - It appears that y increases significantly with x1, suggesting a polynomial relationship.\n\n2. Reviewing previous suggestions:\n   - The simplest previous suggestion is 'c[0]*x1**2' with complexity 5, but it has high mse.\n   - The best mse so far is achieved by '(c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1+c[2])/(c[3]+sqrt(x1))' with complexity 16 and mse 1739.77333741.\n\n3. Based on previous equations, a cubic polynomial or a rational function could capture the complexity.\n   \n4. Consider additional diverse forms:\n   - Given the significant increase in y, a higher degree polynomial or division by a polynomial might be effective.\n   - Utilize combinations of x1, x1**2, x1**3, sqrt(x1) to form new expressions.\n\n5. Proposed simpler forms:\n   - Using a quadratic term 'c[0]*x1**2' is basic but can be combined with linear or constant terms for diversity.\n   - A form like 'c[0]*x1**3 + c[1]' might capture the cubic nature without extra terms.\n\n6. Aim for diversity:\n   - Consider rational forms for added diversity, e.g., 'c[0]*x1**2 / (c[1] + x1)'.\n   - Consider combinations of sqrt(x1) for alternative growth models.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. The dataset shows a clear non-linear relationship between `y` and `x1`. The equations that have been previously suggested show varying degrees of complexity and mean squared error (MSE).\n\n2. We have to balance between the complexity of the equation and the accuracy (MSE) it provides. The simplest equation with the highest error is `c[0]*x1**2` (complexity 5, MSE of 232415.87), while the most complex equation with the lowest error is `c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1**2+c[2]` (complexity 11, MSE of 1739.77).\n\n3. Observing the patterns in the list, polynomial terms, linear terms, and rational expressions have been explored. It seems that as complexity increases, the MSE decreases, but we want to find a balance.\n\n4. For diversity, we should consider combinations of polynomial and rational forms, possibly including square roots only if they seem beneficial.\n\n5. Suggestions should avoid SR-similarity. Therefore, each suggested equation should have a distinct structural form that cannot be easily reduced or transformed into another equation by adjusting constants alone.\n\n6. The dataset suggests we can try the following forms:\n   - A rational function with polynomial numerators and denominators.\n   - A function using square roots in a different configuration.\n   - A combination of linear and quadratic terms.\n\nPotential new expressions:\n1. A rational function form: `(c[0]*x1**2 + c[1]) / (c[2] + c[3]*x1)`\n   - This introduces a rational function without using square roots, aiming for a novel structure.\n\n2. A form involving square roots: `c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]*x1**2`\n   - This is a hybrid of existing terms, but structured differently without constant terms.\n\n3. A polynomial form with a twist: `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*x1**3`\n   - This combines linear and cubic terms, offering a different polynomial structure.",
