For example, 'c[0]*x1' (complexity 3) has an MSE of 592043.0850335.\n   - Lower MSE values are generally associated with more complex models. For example, 'c[0]*x1+c[1]*x1*sqrt(x1)' (complexity 10) with an MSE of 13.70469374.\n   - We should aim for a balance between complexity and MSE, ensuring the new expressions are not redundant with prior suggestions.\n\n3. **Considerations for New Expressions:**\n   - We need diverse expressions that are not SR-similar with existing ones.\n   - We should leverage the independent variable x1 with combination of basic operations (+, -, *, /, sqrt).\n   - Avoid direct combinations of previously suggested terms to ensure diversity.\n\n4. **Potential New Expressions:**\n   - Using square root operations can help capture non-linear behavior without increasing complexity excessively.\n   - Rational expressions (fractions) and polynomials with different degrees or combinations can provide diverse models.\n   - Consider using combinations of terms that have not been directly used in the same form.\n\n5. **Proposed Expression Structures:**\n   - Expression involving sqrt and division: `c0/sqrt(x1) + c1*x1`\n   - Expression using polynomial and division: `c0*x1 + c1/(x1 + c2)`\n   - Expression with mixed terms: `c0*sqrt(x1) + c1*x1*x1`",
