  adsorption onto mica, with pressure as the independent variable (x1) and loading as the dependent variable (y).\n- We are limited to basic 
  arithmetic operations and need to use placeholders for the constants (like c0, c1, etc.).\n- Given the nature of adsorption processes, 
  they often follow isotherm models such as Langmuir or Freundlich. These can be nonlinear and involve terms that could look like c0*x1/(c1 + x1) 
  or c0*x1^c1 forms.\n- Another common relationship is a polynomial form, which is a generic, flexible approach for fitting data when specific 
  models are not strictly defined.\n- Let's consider a few potential forms:\n  1. A simple linear expression: y = c0 * x1 + c1\n  2. A rational expression: y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1)\n  3. A polynomial expression: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2\n\nGiven the constraints, these forms should provide a balance between simplicity and the ability to capture potential non-linear relationships.",
