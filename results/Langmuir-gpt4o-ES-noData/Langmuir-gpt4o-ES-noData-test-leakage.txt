      ...Sure, let's analyze the given dataset and come up with plausible expressions.

---

Scratch Pad:

1. **Objective**: We need to derive expressions that describe the relationship between x1 (pressure) and y (loading) using basic arithmetic operators and constants. 

2. **Nature of the dataset**: The task involves modeling nitrogen adsorption onto mica, which often includes physical adsorption phenomena. This can sometimes resemble isotherm models like Langmuir or Freundlich, but we must adhere to basic arithmetic operations only.

3. **Basic observations**:
    - Adsorption is often non-linear with respect to pressure.
    - Possible simple relationships could include direct proportionality, inverse proportionality, or polynomial terms.
    - Given the restriction of not using complex functions, let's consider simple polynomial forms and rational functions.

4. **Potential expressions**:
    - A linear or polynomial relationship: \( y = c0 + c1 \cdot x1 + c2 \cdot x1^2 \). This accounts for a potential quadratic behavior.
    - A rational function: \( y = c0 \cdot x1 / (c1 + x1) \). This resembles a simple saturation model.
    - A combination of polynomial and rational form: \( y = (c0 \cdot x1 + c1) / (c2 + x1) \). This allows for a ratio that might describe saturation or plateauing behavior.

5. **Constraints**:
    - No constants are to be fitted, hence we will use placeholders like c0, c1, etc.
    - The expressions need to be concise....

      ...Sure, let's analyze the dataset. Given the context of nitrogen adsorbing onto a surface, a common model for adsorption isotherms is the Langmuir isotherm, which is represented by a hyperbolic relationship. 
Thus, we might consider expressions that mimic this behavior. However, as we are constrained to linear operations and cannot use exponentials or other non-linear functions, we'll need to approximate this behavior using only the allowed operations.

1. **Linear relationship**: 
   A simple linear relationship that could capture a basic trend between pressure and loading is a straight line. This is the simplest form where we directly assume that loading is proportional to pressure.

2. **Rational function**:
   Given the nature of adsorption, a rational function (a ratio of polynomials) could approximate the saturation behavior (as pressure increases, loading tends to level off).

3. **Polynomial**:
   A quadratic or cubic polynomial can capture more complex relationships, potentially modeling the curvature seen in adsorption phenomena.

Let's consider these ideas while forming the expressions....

      ...Scratch Pad:

- The equations provided vary in complexity and mean squared error (mse), a measure of prediction accuracy.
- The goal is to find equations that balance low complexity with low mse.
- Some of the lower complexity expressions already have relatively low mse, such as 'c[0]*x1/(c[1]+x1)' with complexity 7 and mse 0.12263081.
- The next simplest expression 'c[0]+c[1]*x1/(c[2]+x1)' has slightly better mse of 0.12213021, with complexity 9.
- The most complex expressions have the best mse, but we want to avoid very high complexity.
- We want to propose new equations that are different in form but can achieve a similar balance between mse and complexity.
- We also need to ensure that the new equations are not SR-similar to the ones already provided.
- Consider rational expressions or combinations that could potentially yield low mse without increasing complexity too much.

Potential new equations:
1. A formulation similar to Michealis-Menten or Langmuir models might work well, such as c0*x1/(c1 + x1) but with a twist, maybe adding another term.
2. Introducing a quadratic term in the denominator might provide a good trade-off, for example, c0/(c1 + c2*x1 + x1*x1).
3. A ratio of linear to quadratic terms can offer a balance, e.g., (c0 + c1*x1)/(c2 + x1*x1)....

      ...Sure, let's analyze the dataset.

Scratch Pad:
1. The dataset involves the relationship between pressure (x1) and 
  nitrogen loading (y) on mica.
2. We need to find simple expressions that can approximate this relationship using basic mathematical 
  operations.
3. To start, let's consider the simplest forms that might capture a non-linear relationship, such as:
   
  - Linear: y = c0 * x1 + c1
   - Polynomial: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2
   - Rational: y = c0 / (c1 + x1)
4. 
  The equations should balance simplicity with fit accuracy. Since we can't fit constants explicitly, we'll represent them with c0, c1, etc.
5. 
  The choice of expression will depend on the observed pattern between the variables. Common adsorption patterns can be linear, 
  Langmuir isotherm-like (which is a form of rational expression), or polynomial if there are multiple adsorption layers or sites.
  

Based on this, let's construct some expressions:

- A simple linear approximation might be appropriate for low-pressure ranges.
  
- A quadratic form can capture more complex nonlinear relationships.
  
- A rational expression can model saturation behaviors, such as the Langmuir isotherm....

      ...Scratch Pad:

1. 
  **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The dataset involves nitrogen adsorption onto mica.
   - The independent variable (x1) is pressure, 
  and the dependent variable (y) is loading.
   - We need to relate y and x1 using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and 
  unknown constants (c0, c1, ...).

2. 
  **Analyzing Potential Patterns**:
   - Adsorption processes often have a saturation effect; hence, they might resemble hyperbolic or 
  Langmuir-type isotherm expressions.
   - Linear, polynomial, and rational expressions are common exploratory starting points.

3. 
  **Considering Models**:
   - **Linear Model**: Simply a straight line, y = c0 + c1*x1. This might be too simplistic but is a good baseline.
   
  - **Polynomial Model**: Quadratic or cubic, such as y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2. This could capture more curvature.
   
  - **Rational Model**: Such as y = (c0 + c1*x1) / (1 + c2*x1). This can capture saturation effects common in adsorption.

4. 
  **Expression Suggestions**:
   - Try a simple linear relation.
   - Consider a quadratic term to capture potential non-linear trends.
   
  - Use a rational expression to potentially capture saturation behavior.

5. 
  **Expression Construction**:
   - For simplicity and adherence to the constraints, all constants (c0, c1, ...) will represent coefficients....

      ...Sure, let's analyze the dataset to find some potential expressions.

Scratch Pad:
- The dataset involves nitrogen 
  adsorption onto mica, with pressure as the independent variable (x1) and loading as the dependent variable (y).
- We are limited to basic 
  arithmetic operations and need to use placeholders for the constants (like c0, c1, etc.).
- Given the nature of adsorption processes, 
  they often follow isotherm models such as Langmuir or Freundlich. These can be nonlinear and involve terms that could look like c0*x1/(c1 + x1) 
  or c0*x1^c1 forms.
- Another common relationship is a polynomial form, which is a generic, flexible approach for fitting data when specific 
  models are not strictly defined.
- Let's consider a few potential forms:
  1. A simple linear expression: y = c0 * x1 + c1
  2. A rational expression: y = (c0 * x1) / (c1 + x1)
  3. A polynomial expression: y = c0 * x1^2 + c1 * x1 + c2

Given the constraints, these forms should provide a balance between simplicity and the ability to capture potential non-linear relationships....

      ...Scratch Pad:

Given the dataset about nitrogen adsorbing onto mica, and the existing Pareto front, I need to suggest new equations that balance both complexity and mean squared error (mse). The current best mse is around 0.11864175 with a complexity of 9. 

1. The simplest equation c[0]*x1+c[1] has a high mse of 6.88412121. This suggests a linear model is not suitable.

2. The equation c[0]*x1/(x1+c[1]) with complexity 7 and mse 0.12263081 is a rational function, suggesting a saturation behavior which is common in adsorption processes. 

3. The equation (c[0]*x1+c[1])/(c[2]*x1+c[3]) improves the mse slightly to 0.12213021, indicating that adding a linear denominator helps fit better, but adds complexity.

4. The equation x1*(c[0]+c[1]/(c[2]+x1)) with complexity 9 and mse 0.11864175 suggests a Langmuir-like isotherm, a common model for adsorption, which performs the best in terms of mse among the given ones.

To suggest new equations, I aim to maintain or reduce the complexity while trying to achieve similar or better mse.

- Using rational functions seems promising, so I should explore variations of these.
- A Langmuir-like or Freundlich-like model might be useful.
- I should avoid SR-similar forms to the existing ones.

Potential new equations:

1. A variation of the Langmuir model, possibly altering the form slightly:
   - x1/(c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1^2)

2. A different rational approach:
   - (c[0] + c[1]*x1)/(1 + c[2]*x1)

3. A different form that maintains the rational behavior:
   - x1/(c[0] + c[1]/(c[2] + c[3]*x1))...
