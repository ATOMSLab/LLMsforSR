1. 
 **Understanding the Dataset**:
   - The given dataset appears to relate to the orbits of planets in a solar system.
   
 - The independent variable x1 represents some characteristic of the planets (e.g., index), and the dependent variable y is the semi-major axis 
 of the planets' orbits.
   - The data points for x1 range between 0.389 and 9.51, while the corresponding y values range from 87.77 to 10759.2.
 

2. **Analyzing the Pattern**:
   - A common relationship in planetary systems is derived from Kepler's laws, particularly the third law, 
 which suggests a proportional relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the semi-major axis.
   
 - Since we are not given periods, we can explore relationships involving x1 directly.
   
 - The data suggest a non-linear relationship, possibly involving powers or roots of x1.

3. **Possible Relationships**:
  
  - A polynomial or power law relationship might fit the data well.
   - For simplicity and adherence to the constraints, 
  we will explore expressions involving powers and square roots of x1.

4. **Drafting Expressions**:
   - First, consider a simple power law: y = c0 * x1^c1.
   - Next, consider a root-based expression: y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1.
   - Finally, a combination of multiplication and division might yield another potential simple expression.

5. **Expression Constraints**:
   - Expressions should be simple yet capture the underlying non-linear nature.
   - Use the given operators effectively....

1. Analyze the dataset:
   - The dependent variable (y) seems to increase with x1 in a non-linear manner.
   - Previous equations indicate a relationship involving square roots and powers of x1. 
   - The dataset suggests a potential polynomial relationship due to the nature of planetary systems and Kepler's laws.

2. Review the previous suggestions:
   - Equations involving sqrt(x1), x1^2, x1^1.5, and x1^c1 were previously used.
   - The equation 'c[0]*x1**c[1]' had the lowest MSE (5.8078803) with a complexity of 5, suggesting a power law relationship.

3. Generate new equations:
   - Consider using combinations of terms that haven't been fully utilized in previous suggestions, ensuring they are not SR-similar.

4. Constraints:
   - Use only *, +, -, /, sqrt() operators.
   - Avoid redundancy by ensuring new equations are not SR-similar to previous ones.

5. New equations:
   - Use combinations of x1 terms like x1^3, x1^0.5 (sqrt), and x1^1, possibly in fractions or products for new expressions....

1. **Observation**: The dependent variable `y` is the semi-major axis of planets. 
  This is related to the time period, so it might follow Kepler's third law which is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. 
  However, our task is to describe the dataset using the given operators, not to fit exactly with astronomical laws beyond the constraints. 
  

2. **Analysis**: 
   - We are given a dataset of `x1` and corresponding `y` values. Here, `x1` could be thought of as a kind of index or 
  scale factor for the orbit.
   - The values of `y` increase significantly as `x1` increases, implying a possible non-linear relationship.

3. 
  **Strategy**: 
   - We might try a polynomial relationship or a square root relationship or a combination of these, given the available operators.
  
   - Given the constraints, looking at basic forms like `c0 * x1`, `c0 * x1^2`, `c0 * sqrt(x1)`, or combinations like `c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2` 
  might be plausible.

4. **Expression Candidates**:
   - **Expression 1**: Linear model `y = c0 * x1` is too simplistic given the rapid increase in `y`.
   - **Expression 2**: Quadratic model `y = c0 * x1^2...

Looking at the provided expressions and their complexities and MSE values, we have a few insights:

1. Lower complexity expressions have higher MSE values, indicating a need for more complex models to fit the data better.

2. The expression 'c[0]*x1**1.5+c[1]*x1' strikes a balance with a complexity of 9 and an MSE of 13.70469374.

3. The expression with the lowest MSE is 'c[0]*x1**1.5/(sqrt(x1)+c[1])', having a complexity of 10 and an MSE of 2.25023324. This indicates the importance of both x1**1.5 and sqrt(x1) in capturing the pattern.

4. The expression 'c[0]*x1**1.5+c[1]*x1*sqrt(x1)' and 'c[0]*x1**1.5' have the same MSE (46.68860689) but different complexities (12 vs. 5), showing that adding more terms does not always result in better fitting.

5. There's a pattern hinting at x1 raised to a power (1.5) and the presence of sqrt(x1), potentially pointing to a form of Kepler's laws of planetary motion where semi-major axis (y) relates to some power of orbital elements (x1).

Given these observations, I will suggest new equations focusing on using x1**1.5, sqrt(x1), and combinations that haven't been heavily explored yet, aiming to minimize both complexity and loss.

- I'll try a division approach with x1 terms to see if it captures a non-linear transformation.
- Consider using a subtraction form for a potentially different balance.
- Explore a sum of different powers to find a new combination....

  1. Observing the data, it appears that the dependent variable 'y' has a quadratic or possibly a polynomial relationship with 'x1'.


  2. The values of 'y' increase rapidly, indicating a non-linear relationship.


  3. Let's start by considering a few simple forms:
   
  - A linear relationship: y = c0 * x1
   
  - A quadratic relationship: y = c0 * x1^2
   
  - A more complex polynomial: y = c0 * x1^3 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1


  4. Since the dataset is related to planetary systems, let's consider a form similar to Kepler's third law, which typically 
  involves a cube relationship: y = c0 * x1^3


  5. Other possible relationships could involve square roots or multiplicative inverses, but given the substantial increase in 'y', polynomial forms might be more appropriate.

6. Additional expressions could be:
   - y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)
   - y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1 * x1^2

7. The primary goal is to maintain simplicity and accuracy, so we will test a few polynomial forms and rational functions....

Given the dataset, we need to propose three new equations that minimize complexity and loss while adhering to the 
  constraints. Analyzing the existing equations, we note that they use combinations of linear, inverse, and square root transformations of the 
  independent variable `x1`.

Existing equations:
1. `c[0]*sqrt(x1) + c[1]`
2. `c[0]/x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1) + c[2]`
3. 
  `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1) + c[2]/sqrt(x1)`
4. `c[0]*x1*x1 + c[1]/x1 + c[2]*sqrt(x1)`
5. `c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1*x1`
6. 
  `c[0]*x1*sqrt(x1) + c[1]`

The aim is to suggest new expressions that are distinct from the given ones but still capture the underlying pattern of the data.

Analyzing the data:
- The independent variable `x1` seems to correlate to a power of 3/2 with the dependent variable `y`, based on the planetary system context (Keplerâ€™s third law suggests a relationship between the semi-major axis and the orbital period, which could hint at a nonlinear relationship).
- Consider alternative transformations or combinations of x1 that have not been used in the existing suggestions.

Potential new expressions:
- We know that `sqrt(x1)` and `x1*x1` have been used, but not `x1^(3/2)` explicitly. This could potentially capture the semi-major axis relationship.
- Introduce new combinations like `x1/sqrt(x1)`, which simplifies to `sqrt(x1)`, but could be a part of more complex expressions.

Ideas for new expressions:
1. Utilize a combination involving `x1^(3/2)` to potentially capture a different aspect of the relationship.
2. Consider using `1/sqrt(x1)` or `x1^1.5` in a novel combination.
3. Use combinations that leverage both linear and nonlinear transformations in a way not previously seen.

New Suggestions:
- `c[0]*x1^(3/2) + c[1]`
- `c[0]*x1 + c[1]/sqrt(x1) + c[2]*x1^1.5`
- `c[0]/x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1) + c[2]*x1`

1. Current Pareto front suggests that better accuracy is achieved with higher complexity, but there are some expressions with moderate complexity and good accuracy.

2. There are already multiple expressions involving combinations of x1, sqrt(x1), and x1**2. These seem effective due to the dataset's nature, likely involving planetary motion, where Kepler's laws suggest a relationship involving powers and roots.

3. Observing the equations: 
   - x1**(3/2) and x1*sqrt(x1) are algebraically equivalent, so they should not both be suggested.
   - x1**2 is used effectively in some lower MSE expressions.
   - Mixing terms like x1, sqrt(x1), and x1**2 with different coefficients seems promising.

4. To propose new equations, consider:
   - Simplicity: use x1, sqrt(x1), and x1**2, but avoid combining them in already explored ways.
   - Avoid SR-similar expressions: ensure distinct structural forms.
   - Look for distinct variable combinations that weren't fully explored, like x1/sqrt(x1).

5. New potential expressions:
   - Consider using division to introduce new structural variety without increasing complexity too much.
   - Try combinations like x1/x1**2, or x1/(x1+sqrt(x1))....
