  1. Observing the data, it appears that the dependent variable 'y' has a quadratic or possibly a polynomial relationship with 'x1'.\n\n
  2. The values of 'y' increase rapidly, indicating a non-linear relationship.\n\n
  3. Let's start by considering a few simple forms:\n   
  - A linear relationship: y = c0 * x1\n   
  - A quadratic relationship: y = c0 * x1^2\n   
  - A more complex polynomial: y = c0 * x1^3 + c1 * x1^2 + c2 * x1\n\n
  4. Since the dataset is related to planetary systems, let's consider a form similar to Kepler's third law, which typically 
  involves a cube relationship: y = c0 * x1^3\n\n
  5. Other possible relationships could involve square roots or multiplicative inverses, but given the substantial increase in 'y', polynomial forms might be more appropriate.\n\n6. Additional expressions could be:\n   - y = c0 * x1 / (c1 + x1)\n   - y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1 * x1^2\n\n7. The primary goal is to maintain simplicity and accuracy, so we will test a few polynomial forms and rational functions.",
