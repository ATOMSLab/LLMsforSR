 **Understanding the Dataset**:\n   - The given dataset appears to relate to the orbits of planets in a solar system.\n   
 - The independent variable x1 represents some characteristic of the planets (e.g., index), and the dependent variable y is the semi-major axis 
 of the planets' orbits.\n   - The data points for x1 range between 0.389 and 9.51, while the corresponding y values range from 87.77 to 10759.2.
 \n\n2. **Analyzing the Pattern**:\n   - A common relationship in planetary systems is derived from Kepler's laws, particularly the third law, 
 which suggests a proportional relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the semi-major axis.\n   
 - Since we are not given periods, we can explore relationships involving x1 directly.\n   
 - The data suggest a non-linear relationship, possibly involving powers or roots of x1.\n\n3. **Possible Relationships**:\n  
  - A polynomial or power law relationship might fit the data well.\n   - For simplicity and adherence to the constraints, 
  we will explore expressions involving powers and square roots of x1.\n\n4. **Drafting Expressions**:\n   - First, consider a simple power law: y = c0 * x1^c1.\n   - Next, consider a root-based expression: y = c0 * sqrt(x1) + c1.\n   - Finally, a combination of multiplication and division might yield another potential simple expression.\n\n5. **Expression Constraints**:\n   - Expressions should be simple yet capture the underlying non-linear nature.\n   - Use the given operators effectively.",
