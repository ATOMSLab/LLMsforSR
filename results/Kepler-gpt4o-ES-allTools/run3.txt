  "LLM Initial Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\n1. **Observation**: The dependent variable `y` is the semi-major axis of planets. 
  This is related to the time period, so it might follow Kepler's third law which is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. 
  However, our task is to describe the dataset using the given operators, not to fit exactly with astronomical laws beyond the constraints. 
  \n\n2. **Analysis**: \n   - We are given a dataset of `x1` and corresponding `y` values. Here, `x1` could be thought of as a kind of index or 
  scale factor for the orbit.\n   - The values of `y` increase significantly as `x1` increases, implying a possible non-linear relationship.\n\n3. 
  **Strategy**: \n   - We might try a polynomial relationship or a square root relationship or a combination of these, given the available operators.
  \n   - Given the constraints, looking at basic forms like `c0 * x1`, `c0 * x1^2`, `c0 * sqrt(x1)`, or combinations like `c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2` 
  might be plausible.\n\n4. **Expression Candidates**:\n   - **Expression 1**: Linear model `y = c0 * x1` is too simplistic given the rapid increase in `y`.\n   - **Expression 2**: Quadratic model `y = c0 * x1^2` could capture initial non-linear growth.\n   - **Expression 3**: Cubic model `y = c0 * x1^3` might fit better given the steep increase.\n   - **Expression 4**: Combination model like `y = c0 * x1 + c1 * x1^2` might also fit.\n\n5. **Selection**:\n   - Prioritize simple expressions that capture the non-linear trend.",
