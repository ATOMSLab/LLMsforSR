The equations already provided give us a clue about potential expressions:\n   - The expression `c[0]*sqrt(x1)+c[1]` is quite simple but has high MSE, indicating that a square root transformation might not be capturing the non-linearity adequately.\n   - The expression `c[0]+c[1]*x1+c[2]*x1*x1`, a quadratic form, is much better with a lower MSE, suggesting that quadratic relationships are promising.\n   - The expression `c[0]*x1*sqrt(x1)+c[1]` has the lowest MSE, suggesting that a function involving both x1 and sqrt(x1) is a good direction to explore.\n\n3. To minimize complexity and loss, aim for variations that balance simplicity with the ability to capture non-linear patterns:\n   - Using combinations of linear, quadratic, and square root transformations.\n   - Avoiding SR-similar expressions by looking for fundamentally different forms or transformations.\n\n4. Potential new expressions could include:\n   - Using reciprocal transformations for curvature adjustments.\n   - Exploring multiplicative combinations of x1 and sqrt(x1).\n\n5.

  `c[0]*x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1) + c[2]/sqrt(x1)`\n4. `c[0]*x1*x1 + c[1]/x1 + c[2]*sqrt(x1)`\n5. `c[0] + c[1]*x1 + c[2]*x1*x1`\n6. 
  `c[0]*x1*sqrt(x1) + c[1]`\n\nThe aim is to suggest new expressions that are distinct from the given ones but still capture the underlying pattern of the data.\n\nAnalyzing the data:\n- The independent variable `x1` seems to correlate to a power of 3/2 with the dependent variable `y`, based on the planetary system context (Kepler\u2019s third law suggests a relationship between the semi-major axis and the orbital period, which could hint at a nonlinear relationship).\n- Consider alternative transformations or combinations of x1 that have not been used in the existing suggestions.\n\nPotential new expressions:\n- We know that `sqrt(x1)` and `x1*x1` have been used, but not `x1^(3/2)` explicitly. This could potentially capture the semi-major axis relationship.\n- Introduce new combinations like `x1/sqrt(x1)`, which simplifies to `sqrt(x1)`, but could be a part of more complex expressions.\n\nIdeas for new expressions:\n1. Utilize a combination involving `x1^(3/2)` to potentially capture a different aspect of the relationship.\n2. Consider using `1/sqrt(x1)` or `x1^1.5` in a novel combination.\n3. Use combinations that leverage both linear and nonlinear transformations in a way not previously seen.\n\nNew Suggestions:\n- `c[0]*x1^(3/2) + c[1]`\n- `c[0]*x1 + c[1]/sqrt(x1) + c[2]*x1^1.5`\n- `c[0]/x1 + c[1]*sqrt(x1) + c[2]*x1`\n\nThese expressions offer diverse transformations of `x1` and incorporate both linear and nonlinear elements in novel ways, distinct from the existing equations.",

The simplest equation provided, 'c[0]*sqrt(x1)+c[1]', has a high MSE, indicating that a simple square root relationship is not capturing the complexity well enough on its own.\n\n4. More complex equations like 'c[0]*x1**2+c[1]*x1*sqrt(x1)+c[2]' have lower MSE values, showing that quadratic and mixed power relationships better fit the data.\n\n5. Observing that the best fitting equations have a non-integer power of x1 (like 1.5), and considering the physical context, it seems beneficial to explore equations that mix different powers of x1.\n\n6. Avoiding SR-similar expressions, it\u2019s important to create diverse expressions that utilize different combinations of x1, x1 squared, and x1 to the power of 1.5.\n\n7. Previous equations used combinations of x1, x1 squared, and x1 to the power of 1.5, which achieved higher accuracy. Exploring new combinations with these components, while keeping complexity low, could yield diverse yet effective expressions.\n\n8. Considering these observations, potential novel expressions could involve combinations of terms like x1, sqrt(x1), x1 squared, and x1 to the power of 1.5, potentially with divisions or additional terms to balance complexity and accuracy.",

  "LLM Thoughts": "Scratch Pad:\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to create new expressions that balance complexity and accuracy. The existing Pareto front provides a variety of expressions with different complexities and mean square errors (mse). We need to look for regions in complexity space that are not yet explored or where improvement seems possible.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Lower complexity expressions (around 6-10) tend to have higher mse, indicating underfitting.\n2. Higher complexity expressions (12-16) have significantly lower mse, but can be overly complex.\n3. The expressions are primarily functions of x1 and its transformations like sqrt(x1) and x1 raised to various powers.\n\nTo generate new expressions:\n- We can explore using combinations of terms not present in the current set.\n- Using simple transformations like division and square roots might help reduce complexity while potentially capturing significant variation.\n- We should avoid constructing expressions that are SR-similar to existing ones.\n\nIdeas for new expressions:\n1. Use the square root transformation in combination with division: c0/sqrt(x1) + c1*x1.\n2. Use a mix of quadratic and inverse terms: c0*x1**2 + c1/x1.\n3.
